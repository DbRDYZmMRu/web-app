[Intro]
Stay with me
I’m hoping that it’d be the more vivid

[Chorus]
Stay with me
I’m hoping that it’d be more vivid
I keep pondering
I keep wondering
If i’m on the right track
I keep wondering
I keep pondering
If i’m on the right track

[Verse 1]
When i see you i get b tterflies
Come with me tell me that
I’m different
How i make you flutter
How i make you dream
What do you think of me
Is it different
Is it better
Am i better

[Outro]
