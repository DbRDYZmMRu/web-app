[ verse 1 ]
I hope you had fun
But you knew girl
It’s in your thighs
I hope you get drunk
While am sailing on another shelf
This pills don’t count
It’s because you got me dead
I’ll be your better
If you only heard
How i choked
Every time you told me you love me
How i plot every time i thought i had it
Something from me make you chose me
Now i’m feeling like i can’t get enough of it
I can’t
I can’t
I can’t
Get enough of it
You just plunged for nothing girl
But it’ll be fine
