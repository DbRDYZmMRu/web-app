[Verse 1]
Sipping, out it’s stormy
With the right taste for your summit
When you text
I just want you on my bed
Well, i ever care
That i can’t be your dear
Lover
(teh who)
Can i be your dear lover
(lover)
Well in on my thoughts
It bothers
(bothering me)
If we’re on the third
Well they’re in love, blah, lover
(i just want your touch)
And i’m trying to reach really closer
So how you piece this spot like the other
Ma ah ah ah
Beating my collar phase
