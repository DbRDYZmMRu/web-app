[Verse 1]
Well now i’m alone
I need no one
Yeah i will be better on my own
I’ll be that lonely pole
You ‘on’t need to dance over me
Just let me rest in peace
Alone, alone
I am better alone
So long
You know
It never comes down
Oh!
So my page reads i love you
Feeling like it’s not in line
No affected darling
See you on
Call me nand
Feeling it’s a lovely song
I’m pouring up
I know that i’m a lonely wrong
You’re the only delay
