[Intro]
I want that sh t to be banging
It’s still low

[Verse 1]
Mauve hidden seed
Ah
Morphing in scene
Oh
Take my words
Never let then chirr
Never let them go
Take my love
Never letting vore
Love letter raw
Awake my heart
When it’s far from honour
Take my son
Call it in

[Bridge]
Easy son
Easy son
Easy son
Easy son
Easy son
Easy son
Easy son
Easy son

[Chorus]
All the care
I care
Pall your liver
Your hold on thing
I care
All the care
I always had you in row
