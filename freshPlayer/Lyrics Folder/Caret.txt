[Intro]
Take it slow
Peck my heart
Over here
Take it slow
Hurting
A tape when you’re done

[Verse 1]
It is jumping
Robbing
A steady crowbarring
Sobering
Beautiful
Heaven chute
I fall
I watch you mull
Beautiful
An healthy dote
The rostrum i drum

[Bridge]
A porous heart
A shim charm
A caret in the now
My tug grit
Blob beau
My beaut tomb

[Chorus]
How you calm my heart
Head me forward revolving
I can cater away
Oh oh
How you calm my heart
Head me forward revolving
I can’t call 911
No, oh oh
