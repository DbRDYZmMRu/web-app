[Verse 1]
Help me hold on to myself
Hear me hold on to my attached
Help me hold on to my love
My love don’t pay this much
My love don’t fail this way
Every time i am here
I feel the same
Every time i say words
Doesn’t ring the same
It’s hard
Oh i did that
Easy, hard
Living on
My heart don’t say you yearn now
My love don’t say you yearn

[Outro]
Tracing my tears
Help, hold the air
Minding my lane
Sweating on dev
Breathing, it cost the world
Still, not the one to run
