[Verse 1]
Does it feel like
We fell in love over christmas
I know if you say
Love or the piste sins
I’m on my way, and i’m going check the thesis
Our love in the sole
Like a wrist tease
Oh, only the one
Girl you should know
This is soul
Ride on my mind like a fool
And it is scheming right at you
Cull sigh
Talk to me, even a lie
Talk to me rile
You know you, you run
Ransom by
Girl no, it’s on pi
Oh, i’ll hold your hand
