[Chorus]
Honey, so we’ll evolve
Our love in a vibe
From above
Touch me now
Don’t you say we left it off
Don’t say we’re not enough
Don’t say it
Don’t say it

[Verse 1]
How can take i back words
That i don’t really mean
Do i mean them now
Though i really said it twice
Oh, these words
They come like a clot
And i’m caught in the sore of our love
Armistice, in the morning you promise
But i don’t feel in nothing
It’s scram miss
Oh will you
I want you here
A living video record
