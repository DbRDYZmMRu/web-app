While I'm no more a trick, it's unlikely I can stay away from masturbation.</p>\n\n<p>         I fap a lot that Mariam Rod asks to see it twice a week, which is hard, from being the only number of times my dad will agree to. So at times she gets stodgily made videos, or just pictures.</p>\n\n<p>         It's been impossible to get me to stop, so she's making do with seeing what I'm up to, collecting my releases, which is so as a wife should. Perfect! </p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><i><span class=\"fw-bold\">Bright Emily</span></i></p>\n\n<p>         When the year started, I made something good: it was to keep a list of the ladies that help me get there. I promise you, it's hard to tell if you ever have, especially if she's not as familiar. So with Bright Emily ending 2023 on the 31st of December, I started my list, with the very first entry coming from January 1st, three hours into the new year. And the last easement is of the 26th of March. Now, I present to you twenty-six poems. </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><i><span class=\"fw-bold\">Claudia Tihan</span></i></p>\n\n<p>         Claudia knocked me out three times during the time, but she isn't on this list, while it's important she's mentioned. It shows how much I get off unwittingly.</p>\n\n<p>         It's particular because when the list started on X, which after a while got to be appropriated to celebrate Princess Leonor's eighteenth birthday, achieving adulthood, having met her at seventeen with gully drooly feelings. Some faps were lost in between number eighteen and deciding to record the number nineteen. I had my hit, point proven! Continuing with the record was to catching myself after Claudia, Sommer Ray and faces I now can't remember skidded off to a not so unsettling list. It was to let the fad, now tradition continue, to tease out more meaning of the act away from public scrutiny. So maybe I am by a longer list now.</p>\n\n<p>         If here for an accurate stat figure, this is behind a couple, maybe six or seven pants down for the time chosen.</p>\n\n<p>         For top of the list on who I'd love to get physical with. Well, I'd love to fondle Sommer Ray all life long, and be another reason she giggles. I'll waste no time getting with Madison Beer. It'd be stirred in romance too. And natch, Taylor Swift has been a do-or-die obligation.</p>\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><i><span class=\"fw-bold\">Sommer Ray</span></i></p>\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><i><span class=\"fw-bold\">Madison Beer</span></i></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><i><span class=\"fw-bold\">Taylor Swift</span></i></p>\n\n<p>         A number of the poetry in this collection were written for Paris Hilton on a countdown to her 43rd birthday.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><i>Inspired by <span class=\"fw-bold\">Paris Hilton</span>'s softness.</i></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><i>Love you, big sis</i> 💖<i>. </i></p>"

        <p> In Hilton's universe, eleven represents endings. While I'm no more a trick, it's unlikely I can stay away from masturbation.</p>
        
        <p> I fap a lot that Mariam Rod asks to see it twice a week, which is hard, from being the only number of times my dad will agree to. So at times she gets stodgily made videos, or just pictures.</p>
        
        <p> It's been impossible to get me to stop, so she's making do with seeing what I'm up to, collecting my releases, which is so as a wife should. Perfect! </p>
        
        <p style="text-align:center"><i><span class="fw-bold">Bright Emily</span></i></p>
        
        <p> When the year started, I made something good: it was to keep a list of the ladies that help me get there. I promise you, it's hard to tell if you ever have, especially if she's not as familiar. So with Bright Emily ending 2023 on the 31st of December, I started my list, with the very first entry coming from January 1st, three hours into the new year. And the last easement is of the 26th of March. Now, I present to you twenty-six poems. </p>
        <p style="text-align:center"><i><span class="fw-bold">Claudia Tihan</span></i></p>
        
        <p> Claudia knocked me out three times during the time, but she isn't on this list, while it's important she's mentioned. It shows how much I get off unwittingly.</p>
        
        <p> It's particular because when the list started on X, which after a while got to be appropriated to celebrate Princess Leonor's eighteenth birthday, achieving adulthood, having met her at seventeen with gully drooly feelings. Some faps were lost in between number eighteen and deciding to record the number nineteen. I had my hit, point proven! Continuing with the record was to catching myself after Claudia, Sommer Ray and faces I now can't remember skidded off to a not so unsettling list. It was to let the fad, now tradition continue, to tease out more meaning of the act away from public scrutiny. So maybe I am by a longer list now.</p>
        
        <p> If here for an accurate stat figure, this is behind a couple, maybe six or seven pants down for the time chosen.</p>
        
        <p> For top of the list on who I'd love to get physical with. Well, I'd love to fondle Sommer Ray all life long, and be another reason she giggles. I'll waste no time getting with Madison Beer. It'd be stirred in romance too. And natch, Taylor Swift has been a do-or-die obligation.</p>
        
        
        <p style="text-align:center"><i><span class="fw-bold">Sommer Ray</span></i></p>

        <p style="text-align:center"><i><span class="fw-bold">Taylor Swift</span></i></p>
        
        <p> A number of the poetry in this collection were written for Paris Hilton on a countdown to her 43rd birthday.</p>
        
        <p style="text-align:center"><i>Inspired by <span class="fw-bold">Paris Hilton</span>'s softness.</i></p>

<p>         In Hilton's universe, eleven represents endings. While I'm no more a trick, it's unlikely I can stay away from masturbation.</p>

<p>         I fap a lot that Mariam Rod asks to see it twice a week, which is hard, from being the only number of times my dad will agree to. So at times she gets stodgily made videos, or just pictures.</p>

<p>         It's been impossible to get me to stop, so she's making do with seeing what I'm up to, collecting my releases, which is so as a wife should. Perfect! </p>

<p>         When the year started, I made something good: it was to keep a list of the ladies that help me get there. I promise you, it's hard to tell if you ever have, especially if she's not as familiar. So with Bright Emily ending 2023 on the 31st of December, I started my list, with the very first entry coming from January 1st, three hours into the new year. And the last easement is of the 26th of March. Now, I present to you twenty-six poems. </p>

<p>         Claudia knocked me out three times during the time, but she isn't on this list, while it's important she's mentioned. It shows how much I get off unwittingly.</p>

<p>         It's particular because when the list started on X, which after a while got to be appropriated to celebrate Princess Leonor's eighteenth birthday, achieving adulthood, having met her at seventeen with gully drooly feelings. Some faps were lost in between number eighteen and deciding to record the number nineteen. I had my hit, point proven! Continuing with the record was to catching myself after Claudia, Sommer Ray and faces I now can't remember skidded off to a not so unsettling list. It was to let the fad, now tradition continue, to tease out more meaning of the act away from public scrutiny. So maybe I am by a longer list now.</p>

<p>         If here for an accurate stat figure, this is behind a couple, maybe six or seven pants down for the time chosen.</p>

<p>         For top of the list on who I'd love to get physical with. Well, I'd love to fondle Sommer Ray all life long, and be another reason she giggles. I'll waste no time getting with Madison Beer. It'd be stirred in romance too. And natch, Taylor Swift has been a do-or-die obligation.</p>
