      <h2>Foreword</h2>
      <div>
        <p>You think of when you will portray the credence of armistice, decorate fallen words, wait for a cast of what ambition look like in reviews, because in the moments, their eyes were weighty set to admit to blind spots.</p>
        <p> Being younger has no claim, it’s the same with the <em>unwise</em> re-rise of the wheel inventors, and marking out “cut knots, knots to cut.” It is a diaphragm to breathe through, the other ends of sustenance.</p>
        <p> When pikes aren’t rooted deep, they play a different role, the unserious have their seating and the shape of odds, not only point, they also constitute a legible mention of activity, one that is meaningful anyway.</p>
        <p> When I care to rise and spot the difference, it ends in seeing why we fought so hard, growing up at ten grudges the teen of fifteen, and twenty has no flair for the white stork. When will the fighting stop? The argument of north and not, when the mark is met? It is how the pain I carry around that never hurts describes it, picking from its own cues.</p>
        <p> Collection IV poems have no taste other than mine, it is why in some evincible world, I dedicate them to you, <i>Lily Grace Rothschild.</i></p>

        <p>for everyday, we hop and bloop</p>
        <p>on the kitchen path for our foods</p>

        <p>I’ll let you ride on my back, I’ll stoop</p>
        <p>this sturdy bend doesn’t need a saddle</p>
        <p>but it could be you eat a lot too soon</p>
        <p>so before we leave, you should choose</p>
        <p>for the ride, you’ll have the side muckle</p>
        <p>if you don’t, it will leave me in a brood</p>

        <p>before we changed where we would?</p>
        <p>yours was narrower and I’d always lose</p>
        <p>for your end had no side-space or nook</p>
        <p>but we had fun because I wasn’t ignoble</p>
        <p>introducing <em>Rappynarrow</em> from our bubble</p>
        <p>. . . at the new court, your points were fitful</p>
        <p>so talks of the Olympics got you rankled</p>

        <p>A morn with a lot to do</p>
        <p>they steer you forethought afoot</p>
        <p>or ram you straight in ambush</p>
        <p>sometimes it’s the sun with fast shoes</p>
        <p>other times you’re seeming to not choose</p>
        <p>here is one — thought is flanked with clues</p>
        <p>pulling closer the ebullience of the noose.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>With the plants watered and spruced</p>
        <p>I sat pondering my rule over the roost</p>
        <p>then I’d need something soon to chew</p>
        <p>risotto, toast, frittata, à la carte mottled</p>
        <p>I poured the oppy fluff slosh sum bottled</p>
        <p>but a hot top-pan hit <em>swack</em> in a whoosh</p>
        <p>a hatching mischief hollowing in the pool</p>
        <p>actual clanks, creaks disrupting the groove</p>
        <p>smacks and whacks, snuffing out my needle</p>
        <p><em>three</em>, <em>two</em>, <em>one</em>, the sprechgesang muddle.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Through the window, I see the ladder in a snug</p>
        <p>with the walls to be coloured to my mind’s hue</p>
        <p>and the palette’s primary being of peach fruit</p>
        <p>the winning sensation of the options accrued</p>
        <p>it was weeks ago, believing I had higher moods</p>
        <p>and this could be tub-thumping in a way crude</p>
        <p>but the painter’s level on the rung is uncouth</p>
        <p>and the sensation he smears suffers droop</p>

        <p>His introspection would be flattery</p>
        <p>he muses on trees, birds, and hymns</p>
        <p>may seem to be human, but it’s a spin</p>
        <p>his voice trails, but nowhere is he seen</p>
        <p>and this day, it’s joy bathed kid-beings.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>No one came down, not the adults I mean</p>

        <p>by his prayers to end desires for the freak</p>

        <p>to be found is to have been wimpy as a kid</p>
        <p>he said a prayer in his very careful edging</p>

        <p>he was the only person in all our crossings</p>

        <p>others just laughed in thunder</p>

        <p>they grew with the cup wrapped</p>
        <p>dropping it upend on the counter</p>
        <p>he slid it slow into an open thrash</p>
        <p>the air about him was bossy daft</p>

        <p>he hit the door with a little smack</p>

        <p>we all were seated, as if in a gag</p>
        <p>whispers unsure if we knew better</p>
        <p>we all could get up; take a stand</p>
        <p>but I was alone in the open-plan</p>
        <p>I took my seat at the door bang</p>
        <p>but I could not get my antsy wart</p>
        <p>in there I thought about this man</p>
        <p>his tie was gone in reappearance</p>
        <p>he had done something to his hair</p>
        <p>his left temple was cowlicked apart</p>
        <p>he looked at me uncanny peculiar</p>
        <p>it was a New York minute’s glance</p>
        <p>you know those types; the cue start</p>
        <p>soon we all heard the burr spatter</p>
        <p>and a loud flump in a shush gnast</p>
        <p>the branch had been severed flat</p>
        <p>we all wanted to see him lift that</p>
        <p>I wanted to see the tree in hacks</p>

        <p>I was sure to hear her if she was in the radius</p>
        <p>the light from her flip phone made my skin burn</p>
        <p>as far from the rear of the car park as they went off</p>
        <p>it’s when I noticed she’d been crying all along</p>
        <p>the closing distance as I gawped</p>

        <p>and it was everything that was wrong</p>
        <p>more clapping leaves from an open book in gust</p>
        <p>like open books, my emotions flipped and turned</p>
        <p>and she soon returned as if customary, as if by custom </p>
