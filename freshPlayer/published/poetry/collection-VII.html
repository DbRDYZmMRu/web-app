        "text": "<p>The meaning of life has something to do with seven, I thought for a while. For weeks I studied phone numbers, and soon I dropped the idea after realizing a boy down the street had more sevens in his cell phone number than all the pastor’s numbers I had fed on to justify my hunch. The idea of the number seven charged up with life more than any other was influenced by very popular references, I guess it’s what being a new stoner could do to anyone. But I live in a little community of very few people, a census would peg the headcount no more than a thousand, meaning, I was doing very little socializing. I finally found a beautiful seven to hold on to, just before leaving Dubai city. And now I pass the belt to my dad, Richard Howard Hilton, he is the one who's paid all my debts, from Dubai to Singapore and Puerto Rico, no one says I owe them. I dedicate this to all the adventures you've set me on right from your @rickhilton7 Instagram account.\n<p>It was time to leave the country, I wasn’t getting the fees for the education I had gone over to enrol for sent to me. I had my flight ticket, and very little money to get to the airport. I was assured by my host in the city of Sharjah that the sum would help me down. But soon in the taxi, watching the meter, I was stumped on how much the bill read about half a minute from the pickup point. The highway was lonely, and the streets so bright, were scary. Waiting for a while after my call to halt from the ridiculousness I was encountering, I told him to continue, the bill climbed up anyway in the wait and I went ferreting my backpack for the loose change I had in there.</p>\n<p>Arriving at the busy airport in Dubai brought panics as I had no idea what I’d do, the cabs paused, and occupants went on their way, all these in a max of sixty seconds, even heavy travellers had the streak, it was bad, I learned this from my arrival, but I’d been thrown into a position of feeling sorry for cheating this man off his remuneration. It obviously had to match with the billing display, what I was to tender, but I was seven Dirham of the journey’s charge short. It stunk as I got off, in the bright lights of the city's airport, the feeling that remained was of luck, I felt lucky, more than I had ever thought possible.</p>\n<p>19th of September, 2019 I arrived in Lagos in the morning, the same day as my grandad’s passing, William Barron Hilton. His passing had brought only good luck, and to tell how lucky I still feel,  I dedicate this collection to my dad, now knowledgeable that time’s passing springs meaning in every action, old and new, as it further gives life to events, also, to every good act done. I am lucky to have an awesome driver in life. Dad says to chase the bunny, as I’d be surprised to know my grandad was quite present with me and spoke to me a lot before his passing. That truly wonderful world.</p>\n<p>I . </p>\n"

      <h2>Foreword</h2>
      <div>
        <p>The meaning of life has something to do with seven, I thought for a while. For weeks I studied phone numbers, and soon I dropped the idea after realizing a boy down the street had more sevens in his cell phone number than all the pastor’s numbers I had fed on to justify my hunch. The idea of the number seven charged up with life more than any other was influenced by very popular references, I guess it’s what being a new stoner could do to anyone. But I live in a little community of very few people, a census would peg the headcount no more than a thousand, meaning, I was doing very little socializing. I finally found a beautiful seven to hold on to, just before leaving Dubai city. And now I pass the belt to my dad, Richard Howard Hilton, he is the one who's paid all my debts, from Dubai to Singapore and Puerto Rico, no one says I owe them. I dedicate this to all the adventures you've set me on right from your @rickhilton7 Instagram account.
        <p>It was time to leave the country, I wasn’t getting the fees for the education I had gone over to enrol for sent to me. I had my flight ticket, and very little money to get to the airport. I was assured by my host in the city of Sharjah that the sum would help me down. But soon in the taxi, watching the meter, I was stumped on how much the bill read about half a minute from the pickup point. The highway was lonely, and the streets so bright, were scary. Waiting for a while after my call to halt from the ridiculousness I was encountering, I told him to continue, the bill climbed up anyway in the wait and I went ferreting my backpack for the loose change I had in there.</p>
        <p>Arriving at the busy airport in Dubai brought panics as I had no idea what I’d do, the cabs paused, and occupants went on their way, all these in a max of sixty seconds, even heavy travellers had the streak, it was bad, I learned this from my arrival, but I’d been thrown into a position of feeling sorry for cheating this man off his remuneration. It obviously had to match with the billing display, what I was to tender, but I was seven Dirham of the journey’s charge short. It stunk as I got off, in the bright lights of the city's airport, the feeling that remained was of luck, I felt lucky, more than I had ever thought possible.</p>
        <p>19th of September, 2019 I arrived in Lagos in the morning, the same day as my grandad’s passing, William Barron Hilton. His passing had brought only good luck, and to tell how lucky I still feel,  I dedicate this collection to my dad, now knowledgeable that time’s passing springs meaning in every action, old and new, as it further gives life to events, also, to every good act done. I am lucky to have an awesome driver in life. Dad says to chase the bunny, as I’d be surprised to know my grandad was quite present with me and spoke to me a lot before his passing. That truly wonderful world.</p>

            `    <p><span class="dropcap text-dark">T</span>he meaning of life has something to do with <em>seven</em>, I thought for a while. For weeks I studied phone numbers, and soon I dropped the idea after realizing a boy down the street had more sevens in his cell phone number than all the pastor’s numbers I had fed on to justify my hunch. The idea of the number seven charged up with life more than any other was influenced by very popular references, I guess it’s what being a new stoner could do to anyone. But I live in a little community of very few people, a census would peg the headcount no more than a thousand, meaning, I was doing very little socializing. I finally found a beautiful seven to hold on to, just before leaving Dubai city. And now I pass the belt to my dad, Richard Howard Hilton, he is the one who's paid all my debts, from Dubai to Singapore and Puerto Rico, no one says I owe them. I dedicate this to all the adventures you've set me on right from your <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rickhilton7?igsh=bXprZXBwYTBqbTc5" target="_blank" >@rickhilton7</a> Instagram account. </p>

    <p>              It was time to leave the country, I wasn’t getting the fees for the education I had gone over to enrol for sent to me. I had my flight ticket, and very little money to get to the airport. I was assured by my host in the city of Sharjah that the sum would help me down. But soon in the taxi, watching the meter, I was stumped on how much the bill read about half a minute from the pickup point. The highway was lonely, and the streets so bright, were scary. Waiting for a while after my call to halt from the ridiculousness I was encountering, I told him to continue, the bill climbed up anyway in the wait and I went ferreting my backpack for the loose change I had in there.</p>

    <p>              Arriving at the busy airport in Dubai brought panics as I had no idea what I’d do, the cabs paused, and occupants went on their way, all these in a max of sixty seconds, even heavy travellers had the streak, it was bad, I learned this from my arrival, but I’d been thrown into a position of feeling sorry for cheating this man off his remuneration. It obviously had to match with the billing display, what I was to tender, but I was seven Dirham of the journey’s charge short. It stunk as I got off, in the bright lights of the city's airport, the feeling that remained was of luck, I felt lucky, more than I had ever thought possible.</p>

    <p>              19th of September, 2019 I arrived in Lagos in the morning, the same day as my grandad’s passing, William Barron Hilton. His passing had brought only good luck, and to tell how lucky I still feel,  I dedicate this collection to my dad, now knowledgeable that time’s <i>passing</i> springs meaning in every action, old and new, as it further gives life to events, also, to every good act done. I am lucky to have an awesome driver in life. Dad says to chase the bunny, as I’d be surprised to know my grandad was quite present with me and spoke to me a lot before his passing. <i>That truly wonderful world</i>.</p>
