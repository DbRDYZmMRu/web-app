But what was I actually thinking? I'd arrive at the special brand-line-up sale for their ten-year's anniversary, and the store would be filled with fully clothed ladies, just like the pictures on their Instagram!</p>\n<p>I bet the Biden-Harris administration felt the same way when they took office — not all applause in every corner, but they were here, defining the American soul I carry with me. It resonates everywhere I go. It's so much revelry that, like the words of Miley Cyrus, it's a party in the U.S.A. — I seem to be playing everyone's song, whence their butterflies fly hence.</p>\n<<p>God bless America 🇺🇸.</p>\n"

        <p>Once, I wielded an old saw</p>
        <p>mountain-tall trees fell headlong</p>
        <p>but by the roots, I suffered a drudge </p>

        <p> </p>
        <p>the woodsman’s role gave a jog thrust</p>

        <p>only if I would, could I save the child; man up</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>as the wolf, my saw had big teeth that cut</p>
        <p>and like a newcomer fresh from audition </p>
        <p>cutting with my old saw by a new brochure </p>
        <p>I discovered all along, I'd been a tired actor </p>

      <div>
        <p>Just a month ago, on a Friday, the 20th of December, I visited Zinkata, a women-only clothing store in Lekki, Lagos, with the idea to introduce myself to its owner and read my poetry. But what was I actually thinking? I'd arrive at the special brand-line-up sale for their ten-year's anniversary, and the store would be filled with fully clothed ladies, just like the pictures on their Instagram!</p>
        <p>I bet the Biden-Harris administration felt the same way when they took office — not all applause in every corner, but they were here, defining the American soul I carry with me. It resonates everywhere I go. It's so much revelry that, like the words of Miley Cyrus, it's a party in the U.S.A. — I seem to be playing everyone's song, whence their butterflies fly hence.</p>
        <<p>God bless America 🇺🇸.</p>

But what was I actually thinking? I'd arrive at the special brand-line-up sale for their ten-year's anniversary, and the store would be filled with fully clothed ladies, just like the pictures on their Instagram!</p>

<p>I bet the Biden-Harris administration felt the same way when they took office — not all applause in every corner, but they were here, defining the American soul I carry with me. It resonates everywhere I go. It's so much revelry that, like the words of Miley Cyrus, it's a party in the U.S.A. — I seem to be playing everyone's song, whence their butterflies fly hence.</p>
<p>God bless America 🇺🇸.</p>`,
