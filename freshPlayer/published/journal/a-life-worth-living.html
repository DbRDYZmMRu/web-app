    <p class="nonindent_wsl">         It’s funny, discovering how much of common literature I have no knowledge of. I am amazed at the staggering intrinsic woven in these stories . . . Shakespeare. Having read brave new world — well just a summary; yet to complete the text. Discovering how much of these stories have similar inclines to real word happenings is astonishing, I can only but be content with the gradual uncovering of these great works.</p>

I will be starting a course by Sam Harris; it’s called <i> Waking up with Sam Harris. </i> I can’t wait to start.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Starting the program, really interesting, I discovered a technique of meditation, twice now. First, in a book by Yuval Noah Harari; 21 lessons of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, and now, in the course by Sam Harris, it’s called <strong><i> Vipassana</i> </strong>, it’s translated as <strong><i> insight</i> </strong><i> , </i> gotten from the Buddhism school of <strong><i> Theravada</i> </strong>. The Theravada is said to be the oldest tradition of Buddhism, and the quality of mind to be cultivated, attained, is mindfulness.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         I had a dream, we were kids, got married under a mango tree, kissed and turned to fairies. I had an idea come to me, I’ll put my joy in breaking things, the climax of this, being my bachelor night; breaking plates, cups, all that gives a smash sound, till it pops a joint or lose interest out of sheer fatigue.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         In an age, where all everyone cares about, is narcissism, hence the reason I’m interested in my story. Heather Mac Donald has won my heart, the part that’s mad at close female acquaintances, who’ve chosen to bank their existence on entitlements.

I’ll be giving it a second listen. From the poem of today by Eleanor Farjeon, I learned that poems are for memorizing as well as for memorializing. Makes me ponder what I’ll be memorizing and memorializing in any poem I’ll be writing soon, probably of the love of years past?</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Listening in on the audiobook by Grant Cardone, “Be obsessed or be average”. I’m reminded on the lesson from months back, there is something, to refreshing your mind, just as the bible says, the constant washing of the feet; the symbolism for reminding yourself. There is also something, to reading your own words, as said by Jordan B Peterson in a discourse with him, and Heather Mac Donald, on what the higher in higher education means.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Coming in to this house, my father’s property, one where I spent a lot of years growing up, it’s suddenly reminded me, of how important mental health is, and how easy it is to lose the band. It’s sad, seeing people, full blown sick, being dangerous, not to themselves alone, but to their immediate environment, and people in it.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         The washing of the feet is a wake-up call, haters will be haters. They are the fuel I need for my next level; Jesse Elder says haters aren’t to be given any attention, and you don’t need them. He has an approach to handling them, mine being the aphorism from today’s devotional, “You Don’t Have to Have an Opinion”. The only problem: handling naysayers, the one’s closest, people with the highest affinity at afflicting damage.</p>\n\n    <p> </p><p> </p>"

Apparently, my life has being going, not so impressive, as he’d like it to go. I’ll be having a tongue-in-cheek attitude towards it. A week from now I guess I’ll be in this man’s presence. What are the thoughts I’ll be entertaining, and what suggestions would the surrounding enclave of mystic shenanigans offer? Maybe bones of dead sapiens, I bet they can’t summon the balls to entertain their guest with such bizarreness. Anyway it goes I’ll be having a good one, it’s not my first time being tricked to believe in some mystic phenomenon. </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>I will be starting my day now, just saw the first episode of Rugrats, haven’t seen it all, going great, will probably see it again, I was munching away while watching so I was kind of divided between my sweet tooth and my cliché childhood nostalgic flight. </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         It’s 12:01 AM and I’m listening to <i> My Birthday by Anne Marie</i> , great song, started the lecture on The Bhagavid Gita, no it should be Bhagavad Gita, yes I got it after looking it up. </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         It’s 3:32 PM, sipping from the perennial knowledge fountain of the great ones, I found a great nugget I’d like to deposit here.</p>\n\n    <p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>\n\n    <p><b class=\"fw-bold\">Lesson Bits</b>: </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         An excerpt from today’s poem, quote <i> “It’s modern warfare’s answer to an ancient wisdom trialed and true, when fighting wars, you first destroy all songs of innocence and joy.”</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Acting from Karma-Yoga; not getting attached to the fruits. According to the Bhagavad Vita, your action becomes more effective. Krishna says: “thinking<i>  of objects, attachment is formed in the mind, from attachment, longing, and from longing anger grows. From anger, comes delusion, and from delusion, loss of memory, and from loss of memory, comes the ruin of understanding, from the ruin of understanding, man perishes</i> .” But if you can act in accordance with Karma-Yoga, you’ll be at peace.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         <i> “But the self-controlled man, moving among objects with senses under restraint, free from attraction and aversion, attains the tranquility.”</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Krishna says <i> “He whose mind is not shaken by adversity, who does not hanker after happiness, who is become free from affection, fear, and wrath is indeed the sage of steady wisdom.”</i>  What a lovely image to be the sage of steady wisdom, calm, unperturbed, regardless of what might come.</p>\n\n    <p> </p><p> </p>"

In a world of fallacy and lies, remaining devoted to a life of unperturbed tranquillity can only be sustained in a world where mind shape minds through the proper application of, discernment of objective reality. People with feasible tyrant traits like the immediate younger offspring, after my conception; delineating between alive and dead, living taking precedence, is a specimen for objective prodding. Understanding why siblings raised under the same living conditions, stray from the path of rationality to a cul-de-sac of mentally agitated existence, sprouting a decadence of personal, ethical harmony in nuclear relationships, and communal engagements.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>Living is for the purposeful, to be purposeful is to seek change. To seek change is to have a nucleus of permanence, for change only comes as a morph, not as a replacement. In the understanding of human behaviour, the arrival at perceptions, shaped by conscious tinkering is central at arriving at the base-philosophy that guides ethical conduct.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Listening to Anticlimax by Mae Muller, thinking, how lucky am I to have this song?

I planned on keeping this pithy, but for some hypothetical telepathic phenomenon, I’m yet to laser on; sceptical about this, I will bow to no pseudo-science, I’m here ranting on about thoughts of little significance. Well, what I wanted to pen down is, it’s a beautiful time to be alive. Why? You may ask. Well, tens of centuries ago, my community of tribal bigots will have their ease on the edge, by the constant fear of raiders in thirst of victims’ blood. Maybe the times aren’t so provident, with constant flares of provocation, the one under the lens, being the anticlimax; my neighbour has chosen to live a life that encompasses not just her thoughts, but that of a foreign being, or maybe this computer is hacked like my previous, whichever way it goes, I’ll be in the heart of tranquillity, putting subliminal and outcries of raucous babel where they belong, in the thrash where nulled thoughts go.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Social interaction involves reconciling different aspects of the personality, the <i> epistemic</i>  understanding of the personality being gestalt, I need to find ways of holistic living, preserving the authenticity of character, giving room to proper positioning in ways that allow easy switching of polar activities without a need to induce zeal through the stimulation of the senses.</p>\n\n    <p> </p><p> </p>"

I’ll be penning down two poems today, it’s the day of love, one for Stephanie, another for Esperanza, to love, as we tick away to the inverse bang.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Understanding my triggers, from audible to visual, it’s important I resist temptations; from the lesson bits of yesterday. I need to understand that I have done nothing wrong by improving on myself, I am doing myself a great service by forging on and implementing the best form of technology that builds my mind, and ensures an utmost throughput. Understanding, that my environment is different from the inside world of tranquil, positioning my attention at the laser motion of important impressions, believing that situations are nothing but what they are; external forces with simple blunt invitations that can’t perturb or seize my attention if I don’t break the bond of personal purpose and veneration. Implementing the safe measure of pushing out any self that hopes to validate already concluded, reviewed substrates of understanding and loci flames of purpose, avoiding alluring applications of mitigation with aim of disturbing my rest.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Today is a day of love, but right now I feel hate, its 12:55 PM. Hate is an emotion that stirs out of envy, the envy I feel is the fact that you wielded the power to hurt me. In time I will put a cross around you, a symbol of the hate I feel for you, to stir and feel when you find someone you love. <i> Anonymous neighbor</i> .</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         I was hoping to write haiku poems, but I changed my mind, I’ll rather express the pleasures of my heart, how you make me feel; your love, will you still love me if ever I’m not just yours? Will you be mine if I ever seem screwy? Will you understand the love behind my past mistakes? Will you love my <i> consumed</i> ; my heart? My mistakes? Dear Lulu.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         If pernicious subtle uttered wicked thoughts and acted actions, directed at no one but self; camouflaged from the immediate conscious impression of perception; disguised from the awareness of, intended by inherent intentions of deceiving whom the aimed perceiver is, eventually get to one, know this is a beam at shadows of the loopholes of the mind caught. If living becomes a rationale at understanding objectively what this reality is, with paranoia being an allusion to the impossible nature of a man who seeks to understand the inchoate words of a mob. When this happens, know there has been a distraction of willed attention, leading to paralysis of directional intention, since perception has been seized; focus hijacked. The solution is to ask - what is the ideal idiosyncratic position of purpose at the current time? </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         It’s 10:35 PM, and I’m yet to write the poems, I’ll get dinner now and get to it.</p>\n\n    <p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>\n\n    <p><b class=\"fw-bold\">To-do</b>: </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>Implementing the safe measure of pushing out all self that hopes to validate already concluded, reviewed, substrates of understanding and loci flames of purpose.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p><strong>EDIT </strong> (12/03/2020 11:33A.M):</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>Process of achieving this has begun, with the introduction of the indifferent spectator, I call her BusiSkrit.</p>\n\n    <p> </p><p> </p>"

The physical leash was not as far-reaching or as permanent as the mental leash. </i> This is based on the plot of the scene.

Coransee heads the house, Teray his brother who wills as much power, with a disadvantage, as he leaves school freshly with no house of his own, sold to Coransee by Joachim.

The ongoing intimidation was concocted after the keen observation of the subject in natural states of affair, learning the routinised way of affairs, deciding what elates and irritates, on concluding by coming to an awareness of these simple things, an epithet was introduced: <i> the game mind</i> , dangled as a new way of living, I choose not to elucidate this as I have in the past, the only addition is my new conceptualized understanding of this epithet, an analogy; compared to a game bird, an animal hunted for sport. Since points are counted on successive assaults that lead to derailment of any sort. My understanding of this compound word “game-mind” is the successive belittling of the mind.

A quote</p>\n\n    <p>         <i>  “The particular shade of color that I’m seeing may have many things said about it, I might say that it is brown, rather dark and so on, but such statements though they make me know truths about the color, do not make me know the color itself any better than I did before. So far as concerned the knowledge of the color itself,</i> <strong><i>  as opposed to knowledge of truths about it</i> </strong><i> . I know the color perfectly and completely when I see it, and no further knowledge of it is even theoretically possible. Thus the sense data which make up the appearance of my table are things with which I have acquaintance, and things immediately known to me, just as they are.” </i> What Russell seems to overlook here is that this basic knowledge to which no knowledge can be theoretically added is a place where we uncover an intrinsic limit to understanding. Consider any facet of experience, in this case a vision of color; stirring the tide of thoughts long enough to merely observe it as it is, the fact of being in total ignorance of what it is can become obvious. </p>\n\n    <p>         What is the color blue? Not as a function of wavelengths of light or neurophysiology, but at it is directly perceived. We’re really left with nothing to say but that it’s blue, which does nothing to clarify things, in fact it’s not even blue, which is just a word; it’s a noise we’re making. What we see before us is whatever it ineffably is. Focusing on this distance between concepts and experience is a means of sneaking up on a truth that is generally described in Buddhism, as the <i> The truth of emptiness</i> : the idea that no thing has intrinsic independent existence in the way that it seems. The moment we suspend the conceptual associations we have with a given object, or perception; our knowledge about it, our direct experience of it can gray into this experience of pure mystery. We’re left with this wordless intuition of consciousness and its content.</p>\n\n    <p>         Meditation isn’t about understanding things conceptually, it’s the ability to experience things more clearly, prior to concepts, it’s the knowledge by acquaintance taking to the highest degree, leading to another state of being: a new form of intelligence, a psychological freedom that a continuous entanglement with concept doesn’t. </p>\n\n    <p>         A famous parable from the Buddha meant to get at this difference - A man is struck in the chest by a poison arrow, and a surgeon rushes to his side to begin the work of saving his life, bu the man resist, he wants to know the name of the fletcher who fashioned the arrows shaft, and the type of wood from which it was cut, and the mode of the man who shot it, and the name of the horse upon which he rode, and a thousand other things that have no bearing at all upon his present suffering or his ultimate survival, so this man needs to get his priority straight, his commitment to thinking about <i> world</i>  results from a basic misunderstanding of his predicament. We too have more problems that will not be solved by more thinking.</p>\n\n    <p> </p><p> </p>"

He is later unmoored after successive fallibility. Drawing from my own memories, while on the mandatory internship program in my third year in the university, at computer village, Ikeja. Caught up on a rainy day, outside the office, seeking refuge at a gas station with a colleague, waiting for the rain to subside, a scrawny, untidy man in dirty white coloured robes, a bible under his arm, hobbles past us where we sat knee close to chest, in a traipse manner, he seemed to be begging for alms; more like a mendicant.

Because old experience wane hard.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         An excerpt from today’s reading of a short story by Octavia Butler: Speech Sounds: “<i> His use of the left hand interested Rye more than his obvious question. Left-handed people tended to be less impaired, more reasonable and comprehending, less driven by frustration, confusion, and anger.</i> ” Now I don’t know how true this is, but it’s an interesting statement.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Another excerpt from Octavia Butler’s short story collection titled <strong>The Evening and the Morning and the Night</strong>. <i> “The weird part was, I worked hard, got top grades. If you work </i> <strong><i> hard</i> </strong><i>  enough at something that </i> <strong><i> doesn’t matter</i> </strong><i> , you can </i> <strong><i> forget</i> </strong><i>  for a while about the things that do.” </i> Now drawing from the incident I was just involved in. Helping my mom with her tea, filling up her flask, random activities of little to no significance, my dad calls me, informing me I’ll need to have the waste made available for the trash collector on his arrival. Dropping the flask in my mom’s room, I move forward to helping with the trash, but first, do I have soap to wash after this dirty activity? No! Is it really important, taking the trash out, when he can just come in to get it? Well, his wife says she doesn’t want the trash collector in the compound, another dictum from the madam, at whose peril actually? His? Mine? Why? I’m not so sure. Just another impudence at the individuals in the household who actually do the work. Mind made up. I don’t plan on taking any trash out, if he needs the trash out, he either plays on whomsoever’s logic is needed to have the trash collector come in, or let his <i> slave-boy</i>  - me - as I’ve always been, handle it. But no, he won’t. On returning back to the building, after waiting several minutes, intending to ascertain if he, the trash man still is on his way, I meet with Father, telling me I have to take it out, the following conversation ensued, I paraphrase. </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p><strong>Son</strong>: Where is the man?</p>\n\n    <p><strong>Father</strong>: His cart is full. He has gone to empty it; he says he’ll be coming back soon.</p>\n\n    <p><strong>Father</strong>: Have you taken the trash out?</p>\n\n    <p><strong>Son</strong>: No, I didn’t.</p>\n\n    <p><strong>Father</strong>: Why?</p>\n\n    <p><strong>Son</strong>: I’d rather have him come in to get it.</p>\n\n    <p><strong>Father</strong>: He can’t come in.</p>\n\n    <p><strong>Son</strong>: I have no soap to wash after.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Father gives a scornful remark, imposing his will on mine, I leave his presence, informing him of my defiance as a result of his disdain of my wants. I remember growing up, my dad telling my mom, how he doesn’t know me, he doesn’t know who I am? Think of it. If he doesn’t know who I was, how can he know me; who I currently am? A reference to the letter sent to him should be inferred for proper a priori discerning.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         The reason I relate all these is to draw and infer, showing how easy it is to lose all sense of self, if I had listened to his advice - father - of not reading. I’d be an animal wielded by the raucous of nonchalant individuals with imposing bigoted views, losing sense of the loci flame that has stirred me so far, instead of chasing the wind.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         I switched programs, for the windows media player, with intentions to listen to <i> Wolf Bite</i>  only to have <i> The Real World</i>  by <i> Owl City</i>  played, I was swept away, mood changed, and now I feel lighter; my capricious ass. During the playback, a thought swept through my mind, it was in concession with some lines from the song, how he’d rather live in an imaginary world than live in the real world. I indulge in this by reading books myself, fiction, or non-fiction, any goes, as long as it offers a true episode of escapism, the perfect reverie.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Reading the fable, <i> the house of ELD.</i>  I’m taken to the aisle of memory; in view: on the counter. My high-school graduation year book parting words. I paraphrase: “The lord has given us a course to chart during this lifetime, but not without the opportunity to plot ours”. As few as these words are, they signalled the imminent actions, shaped by fore-thoughts, that’d determine the story of my life. So insinuating were the words to my uncle; the proprietor, he avoided speaking to me directly about it, instead meets with my dad admonishing him. For He’d have my dad call me informing me on how, out of condescending spite, I sound intelligent, when all he actually meant was, good lifting.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         A quick summary of the book, he kills the sorcerer, has his right fetter broken, prior to this he . . .</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         First it’s a metaphor of how to gain freedom, you need to break down the walls of those you love, fight, conquer . . .</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         It so happens that I graduated from high school at fifteen also . . .</p>\n\n    <p> </p><p> </p>"

Man has to initiate it, to sustain it and to bear responsibility for its results. The pre-conceptual level of consciousness is nonvolitional; volition begins with the first </i> <strong><i> syllogism</i> </strong><i> . Man has the choice to think or to evade—to maintain a state of full awareness or to drift from moment to moment, in a semi-conscious daze, at the mercy of whatever associational whims the unfocused mechanism of his consciousness produces.</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         <i> But the living organisms that possess the faculty of consciousness need to exercise it in order to survive. An animal’s consciousness functions automatically; an animal perceives what it is able to perceive and survives accordingly, no further than the perceptual level permits and no better. Man cannot survive on the perceptual level of his consciousness; his senses do not provide him with an automatic guidance, they </i> <strong><i> do not</i> </strong><i>  give him the knowledge he needs, </i> <strong><i> only the material of knowledge</i> </strong><i> , which his mind has to integrate. Man is the </i> <strong><i> only</i> </strong><i>  living species who has to perceive reality—which means: to be conscious—by choice. But he shares with other species the penalty of unconsciousness: destruction. For an animal, the question of survival is primarily physical; for man, primarily </i> <strong><i> epistemological</i> </strong><i> .</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         <i> Man’s unique reward, however, is that while animals survive by adjusting themselves to their background, man survives by </i> <strong><i> adjusting his background to himself</i> </strong><i> . If a drought strikes them, animals perish—man builds irrigation canals; if a flood strikes them, animals perish—man builds dams; if a carnivorous pack attacks them animals perish—man writes the Constitution of the United States. But one </i> <strong><i> does not</i> </strong><i>  obtain food, safety or freedom—by instinct..”</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         <i> “Those who could become the New Intellectuals are America’s hidden assets; their number is probably greater than anyone can estimate; they exist in every profession, even among the present intellectuals. But they are scattered in silent helplessness throughout the country, or hidden in that underground which, in human history, has too often swallowed the best of men’s potential: </i> <strong><i> subjectivity</i> </strong><i> . They are the men who have long since lost respect for the cultural standards to which they conform, but who hide their own convictions or repress their ideas or suppress their minds, each feeling that he has no chance against the others, each serving as both victim and destroyer. The New Intellectuals will be those men who will come out into the open and have the courage to break that vicious circle.</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i>  </i> </p>\n\n    <p>         <i> If they glance at the state of our culture, they will see that the entire miserable show is kept up by nothing but </i> <strong><i> routine</i> </strong><i>  and </i> <strong><i> pretence</i> </strong><i> , which disguise bewilderment and fear: nobody dares to take the first new step, everybody waits for his neighbour’s initiative. If a society reaches the stage where every man accepts the feeling that he is “a stranger and afraid in a world [he] never made,” the world it gives up will be made by Attila. The greatest need today is for men who are </i> <strong><i> not strangers to reality</i> </strong><i> , because they are not afraid of thought. The New Intellectuals will be those who will take the initiative and the responsibility: they will check their own philosophical premises, identify their convictions, integrate their ideas into coherence and consistency, then offer to the country a view of existence to which the wise and honest can repair.</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i>  </i> </p>\n\n    <p>         <i> The New Intellectual will be the man who lives up to the exact meaning of his </i> <strong><i> title</i> </strong><i> : a man who is guided by his intellect—not a zombie guided by feelings, instincts, urges, wishes, whims or revelations. Ending the rule of Attila and the Witch Doctor, he will discard the basic premise that made them possible: the soul-body dichotomy. He will discard its irrational conflicts and contradictions, such as: mind versus heart, thought versus action, reality versus desire, the practical versus the moral. He will be an integrated man, that is: a thinker who is a man of action. He will know that ideas divorced from consequent action are fraudulent, and that action divorced from ideas is suicidal. He will know that the conceptual level of </i> <strong><i> psycho-epistemology</i> </strong><i> —the volitional level of reason and thought—is the </i> <strong><i> basic necessity</i> </strong><i>  of man’s survival and his greatest </i> <strong><i> moral virtue</i> </strong><i> . He will know that men need philosophy for the purpose of living on earth.</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i>  </i> </p>\n\n    <p>         <i> The New Intellectual will be a reunion of the twins who should never have been separated: the intellectual and the businessman. He can come from among the best—that is: the most rational—men who may still exist in both camps. In place of an involuntary Witch Doctor and a reluctant Attila, the reunion will produce two new types: the </i> <strong><i> practical thinker</i> </strong><i>  and the </i> <strong><i> philosophical businessman</i> </strong><i> .</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i>  </i> </p>\n\n    <p>         <i> The best among the present intellectuals should consider the tremendous power which they are holding, but have never fully exercised or understood. If any man among them feels that he is the helpless, ineffectual step-son of a “materialistic” culture that grants him neither wealth nor recognition, let him remember the meaning of his title: his power is his intellect, not his feelings, emotions, or intuitions. It is not the businessmen who have robbed him of efficacy, but those of his colleagues who have degraded his profession to the level of soothsayers, tea-leaf readers, and jungle oracles. Let him break with the neo-mystics; let him realize that ideas are not an escape from reality, not a hobby for “disinterested” neurotics in ivory towers, but the most </i> <strong><i> crucial</i> </strong><i>  and </i> <strong><i> practical </i> </strong><i> power in human existence. Then let him become an intellectual leader who assumes full responsibility for the practical consequences of his theories.”</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Sacrilegious is the holistic make up of the pretender who claims to teach.

One ironic assumption along these lines: that having a lot of money makes you wealthy. Or that because a lot of people believe something, it must be true. </i> I should be reminded of how over the past few months I’ve been attacked throughout the clock, pushing me to a wall of annihilation, annihilation of not just life, this being the last in the gradient of the destructive process set in motion. I have lost proper expression of my cognitive processes, my thoughts hampered by the constant brainwashing, and inducing of hypnotic states that produce awareness of a <i> self;</i>  suggested, as not worked on by self, the constant deliberate mass action of hindering any form of progress as an individual, of the individual.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         I have become chafe from having to wait for the visa appointment, it’s been months now, waiting for the online portal registration, amidst all the lies, I have chosen to keep aloof, in the event of things not working out fine, I have plans. Real plans.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Intelligence is beautiful in all its mystery and misery.

Without a new experience, there can be no growth. A very possibility is a race of identical individuals with little to no arbitrary difference, outside the physiological. Examining the expressions of beings shouldn’t be taken outside of the domain of thought origin, impulse and backgrounds like profession, family. This being a subculture diagnosis.

E. Housman</p>\n\n    <p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>\n\n    <p><b class=\"fw-bold\">Entries</b>: </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Here is a profound insight, two points of view. One from a school of thought, a way of living — Stoicism. And an evolutionary perspective of instinctive response integrated with mythological discernment. The latter from a lecture on the biblical series: <i> Introduction to the idea of God</i>  by Professor Jordan B Peterson, the former from today’s stoic devotional. </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Nature is beautiful. intelligence; beauty with direction. The latter suggest the use of attention and language to confront things that most threaten us. “<i> If there are things that upset — chaotic, terrible, serpentine, monstrous underworld things that threaten — the best thing is to open your eyes, get your speech organized, and go out and confront the thing, and make the world out of it — cancel out the upsetting object</i> .” My understanding of this view is the instinctive discernment of the archetypal problem using perceptual inference. </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         The other suggest, I paraphrase: “<i> When your sparring partner scratches or head-butts you, you don’t then make a show of it, or protest, or view him with suspicion or as plotting against you. And yet you keep an eye on him, not as an enemy or with suspicion, but with a healthy avoidance. You should act this way with all things in life. We should give a pass to many things with our fellow trainees. For, as I’ve said, it’s possible to avoid without suspicion or hate.</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         <i> By seeing each day and each situation as a kind of training exercise, the stakes suddenly become a lot lower. The way you interpret your own mistakes and the mistakes of others is suddenly a lot more generous. It’s certainly a more resilient attitude than going around acting like the stakes of every encounter put the championship on the line.</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         <i> When you catch an elbow or an unfair blow today, shake off the pain and remind yourself: I’m learning. My sparring partner is learning too. This is practice for both of us—that’s all. I know a bit more about him or her, and from my reaction, they’re going to learn a little bit more about me too.</i> ”</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         These two perspectives enjoin us on modes of reaction, a dichotomy of perception and action. I seem to be not just a practicing stoic but a budding philosopher.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Some quotes I found on a look-up of the name <strong>Vladimir Nabokov a </strong>Russian and American novelist, poet, translator, and entomologist:</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p><i> You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style.</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i> It was love at first sight, at last sight, at ever and ever sight.</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i> The breaking of a wave cannot explain the whole sea.</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Some quotes from <strong>Jacques Lacan</strong></p>\n\n    <p><i> What does it matter how many lovers you have if none of them gives you the universe?</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i> The knowledge that there is a part of the psychic functions that are out of conscious reach, we did not need to wait for Freud to know this!</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i> In other words, the man who is born into existence deals first with language; this is a given. He is even caught in it before his birth.</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p><p> </p>"

In potentially negative situations, the objective, even superficial gaze might actually be superior. That view might let us see things clearly without diving too much into what they might represent or what might have caused them. In other situations, particularly those that involve something impressive or praiseworthy, another approach, like that of contemptuous expressions, is helpful. By examining situations from the inside out, we can be less daunted by them, less likely to be swayed by them.</i> </p>\n\n    <p>           <i> Dig into your fear of death or obscurity, and what will you find? Turn some fancy ceremony inside out and you’ll find—what?</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p><p> </p>"

I quote from Why Beauty Matters by Roger Scruton “<i> … why beauty matters. It is not just a subjective thing but a universal need of human beings. If we ignore this we find ourselves in a spiritual desert.</i> ” A reflection from my days of ingesting weed, I remember the epiphany from thought stirring, the revelation of abstainment. I had a moment of aha, <i> now I get it, I shouldn’t stay here</i> . The lack of colour leads to a depravity; a pernicious chronological transition leading to this. I can remember mom saying when she had me for dad, he had no sofa - you know what I mean - and when we moved into ours, we had no tv, mom got the one we used for years, the big inch one he got, barely was used, maybe it broke down, can’t remember.

We must have all started from the trap house, as we were on the lane heading away from there. I don’t ever visit that part of town for anything other than buying crack. There seemed to be a multitude behind us, a crowd of strangers, but it wasn’t overly contradicting; this crowd. If I had fans, they’d be in there. We had made it quite far from the trap house. On a motorcycle, three minutes, maybe. And now, we were close to the roundabout. We weren’t on the wrong side of the road, there is a ditch to the left, and by the right, is the other lane leading back to the trap house. Nothing was out of place, but slowly, the ground clambered, as if, it too had developed legs of its own. Strangely we all continued as if defying gravity. It was so cool, as I could see the big ditch, with those weird eyes that see the whole dream as a whole.

There, I felt out of place, and woke up later. Good convalesce if you ask me?</p>\n\n    <p> </p><p> </p>"

But an allusion to its nature can be a fond conclusion for the uninitiated—the untrained mind. The psychoanalytic methodology of dream interpretation is sacrosanct in understanding events, or more broadly: the articulated sphere of being. I skimmed a book in the arts, and to that, it suggested dreams mean nothing; madness you will find there. In point, the event of this morning—my inability to restrain myself—leading to a little outburst, a result of my emotional frustration at the constant discord reactions; a misjudgement of the constant frivolities, including chores. My opinionated ideas on the importance of a family’s need for an ideal that supports a conduct that reflects success is paramount. It’s important the individual doesn’t lose sense of his identity.

An excerpt from the book The Romanticism Manifesto gives weight: <i> It has been said and written by many commentators that the atmosphere of the Western world before World War I is incommunicable to those who have not lived in that period. I used to wonder how men could say it, know it, yet give it up—until I observed more closely the men of my own and the preceding generations. They had given it up and, along with it, they had given up everything that makes life worth living: conviction, purpose, values, future. They were drained, embittered hulks whimpering occasionally about the hopelessness of life. Whatever spiritual treason they had committed, they could not accept the cultural sewer of the present, they could not forget that they had once seen a higher, nobler possibility. Unable or unwilling to grasp what had destroyed it, they kept cursing the world, or kept calling men to return to meaningless dogmas, such as religion and tradition, or kept silent. Unable to stifle their vision or to fight for it, they took the “easy” way out: they renounced valuing.

My only addition to this is the last timeline from the last phase—the poem audio file—it ends 04:19:33. The digits 419 represent the part of the state law of Nigeria that holds citizens to bear on the laws on fraud. Remembering—not recording in the journal—the epithet from the concluded topic on the psycho-epistemology of art, it ends on the note of <i> the sense of life</i> , citing primitive forms of philosophy like religion, its many myths, and allegories on man’s existence, like the myth of a supernatural recorder from whom nothing can be hidden, who lists all of a man’s deeds. It affirms the principle of staying grounded—not out of kilter—to one’s moral. Back in Dubai my moral volition hit crossroads, almost closing in on a debacle. I think the 33 stands for a transcendence. I can say now I stand in a better place.

When I say “deal with” I mean retranslate all the abstractions into the perceptual concretes for which they stand—i.e., reconnect them to reality—and hold it all in the focus of one’s conscious awareness. There is no way to integrate such a sum without projecting an actual human figure—an integrated concretization that illuminates the theory and makes it intelligible. </i> Another quote: <i> Moral principles remain in their minds as floating abstractions, offering them a goal they cannot grasp and demanding that they reshape their souls in its image, thus leaving them with a burden of undefinable moral guilt. Art is the indispensable medium for the communication of a moral ideal. </i> Jesus is a beautiful attempt at well-crafted art. A model for Christians. <i> Without the assistance of art, ethics remains in the position of theoretical engineering: art is the model-builder.</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p><p> </p>"

My choice to spend time with a friend on his birthday led him, and not just his league of pals, but also a girl I’d held dear for a while, to sift through my actions for reckless volitions. An attack on what is most dear—my identity. The repudiation of a need for consciousness in wakefulness; the allure of blackout through an impersonation of my recent character, reiterated to me in conscious awakening. A foolproof frame-up to suggest of excesses ungrounded. Here goes another set of quotes from the Romantic Manifesto on Art: <i> One of the distinguishing characteristics of a work of art (including literature) is that it serves no practical, material end, but is an end in itself; it serves no purpose other than contemplation—and the pleasure of that contemplation is so intense, so deeply personal that a man experiences it as a self-sufficient, self-justifying primary and, often, resists or resents any suggestion to analyse it: the suggestion, to him, has the quality of an attack on his identity, on his deepest, essential self.</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         <i> No human emotion can be causeless, nor can so intense an emotion be causeless, irreducible, and unrelated to the source of emotions (and of values): to the needs of a living entity’s survival. Art does have a purpose and does serve a human need; only it is not a material need, but a need of man’s consciousness. Art is inextricably tied to man’s survival—not to his physical survival, but to that on which his physical survival depends: to the preservation and survival of his consciousness.</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Note all these in light of my art. The attack on the validity of my artistic expression—denial of the efficacy of my consciousness; the negation of my fundamental understanding of reality—as a prelude to that which is essential—my consciousness. The defaming statement: <i> you said, consciousness isn’t important </i> is a direct inciting, a proposing of minimal intelligence—this being a form of the sub-animal, the instinctive, a semi-conscious wielding of a half-arsed brain wasted away, failed on abstinence; repetitive drug use—being smug okay in guiding and volitive excogitation.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         I should remember the need; and utmost—to know of the things important, the things that matter most—is non-social. To remain conscious of this is important, as the inherent mode of intelligence in itself is insular, constantly regressing and gaining obsoleteness in ever growing complexity. The constant abstraction and assimilation of newly understood concepts is to redefine perceptual inference, the intuitive, and is to reprogram the subconscious. Intelligence in humans without conscious wielding is instinctive—impulse driven, a process, a form of distortion—and not learning, not progressive, it’s to return to the primitive, to leave evolution to the natural selection—a task of billion years. It doesn’t improvise.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Altruism the cancer of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, the cancerous outgrowth in communities; the birth child of culture. <i> One of the grimmest monuments to altruism is man’s culturally induced selflessness: his willingness to live with himself as with the unknown, to ignore, evade, repress the personal (the non-social) needs of his soul, to know least about the things that matter most, and thus to consign his deepest values to the impotent underground of subjectivity and his life to the dreary wasteland of chronic guilt. </i> One of the lethal contamination of the arts is the gradual pernicious encroachment; the spread of false ideals: culturally induced selflessness, the enjoyment of intelligible aesthetics, the failure to fight; to think. If art is the model-builder, what models are being churned out by modern culture? If this is true: <i> The basic purpose of art is not to teach, but to show—to hold up to man a concretized image of his nature and his place in the universe. </i> What image is being represented.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         How about a game of speak and kill, a peek a boo, Sermo Liber Vita Ipsa.</p>\n\n    <p> </p><p> </p>"

It didn’t seem to go forwards or backwards now, but up and down. The past was striated through you, through your body, leaching into the present and the future. The striations were evident, these streaky layers of memory, of experience—but you were one being, you contained all of it. If you looked behind or ahead of you, all was emptiness</i> .

My informed narrative is born of apprehension—resolved in a feat. A trickle of constant misinformation holds no water at my basal contingent. The future stands in objective discernment for those with the right mantle. Words elude those without understanding, a loss of the fact that <i> truth is truth</i> , never wavering. <i> For the physical science is a substrate on which the humanities should stand</i> , any view away from this is a fallacy, a cognitive bias, a deep-running crippling daemon process; a final hindsight bias.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Language is ever evolving, changing to meet the growing needs of an ever developing world. The Yoruba language in its colloquial use, remains one of a myriad of impossible feats; a range of symbols forcing itself on an ever growing expanding meaning set. Grouping in bands, a growing nuanced substrate. The result is a blindness so great. Even a borrowing of a foreign language can’t fix. In my inmate state of mind; current conditioning, I say and state clearly out of remiss: I will never ever keep to heart the words of a tribe that chases insanity in an ever twisting monotony of already based meaning, the overuse of trite words in describing largely disparate domains. To not change or grow in that regard is to chase flies on a sore hollowed.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Forgive my reticence as my present conditioning is its predispose.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Be careful in your studying, on continuing—especially when distracted—lest you build upon sands, instead of rocks.

I listened to a complete song from a bird just out my window. I guess it’s drawing closer to that time of the year—my place. The reason for this entry is finally, I got a crack on the theory of relativity, the spacetime paradigm shift from space and time—space and time being different dimensions—and the keynote of my discovery is the concept of time. When speed increases time reduces, well that’s simple intuition, time here isn’t <i> time</i> , like the Gregorian, it’s relative time. As you move faster, your clock slows down—in relation. This clearly expresses the phenomenon of time dilation. The central idea being, every object moves through spacetime at one speed: The speed of light. Another important point to note about the theory of relativity is its percept of every point being the centre of the universe, calculations are computed with no external reference point.

Hush, tell no one. Well, I’m kinda in love, you know, I feel a certain way; that warm throb that engulfs you like a swirling flame. I miss her, even though knowing what’s like to be with her, her brief instances; of her post. If I lose this, I’ll chalk it up in experience, raise my stained boots and munch up my pride.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         I’ve been turned inside out, growing sick in the air, connected to people who dislike me, some who love me, most who revere me, in all I remain inside out, a match with constant strike outs, a bible of tallied meaning.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         An important except from the book The Stoic Challenge, paraphrased: <i> The Framing Effect - How we mentally characterize a situation has a profound impact on how we respond to it emotionally. The Stoics realized that we have considerable flexibility in how we frame the situations we experience. Their goal wasn’t to banish emotion but to minimize the number of negative emotions. It is tempting, at this point, to describe the Stoics as patient people, and indeed they were, but a caveat is in order. In one sense, a patient person is one who can suffer a setback without complaint. This is not, however, what the Stoics were doing. Their goal was not to remain calm while suffering a setback but rather to experience a setback without thereby suffering.</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         When my second younger sibling comes to mind, I should think of freedom of assembly. She has the right to whatever she pleases; the crowd she wills to be part of. Forgive myself for the times spent harbouring thoughts of disparity.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Another excerpt: One sign of maturity is a realization of the extent to which you, either intentionally or unintentionally, make life difficult for those around you. We are bad men living among bad men; and only one thing can calm us—we must agree to go easy on one another.</p>\n\n    <p> </p><p> </p>"

I hope I can carry on, for my heart is weak and my strength is far spent, and my love is washed away. I have no face to fight for the man who stands next to me for my resolve has been lost. In the event of my death, if its suicide, I hope these words never get to anyone.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         I miss high-school, singing hymns, my girlfriend up there leading the assembly, thoughts of our last smooch, always the night before, and her sweet Christian praises. Had this go through my head while seeing a movie.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Banshee’s mum is a stupid person, who just like the other Scrompus, the stupid bitch who has life in the mist gone has lost her mind. She bears no consequence on her actions and just like my mum’s kids. Her’s will bear the burden if they don’t wake to the reality of things. No one is ever high enough to fall.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         I discovered the concept of <i> curse of knowledge</i>  reviewing the last chapter read from the Skepticism course and I’m thinking—as my blood flows, strewing veins that transit stuff of the gods—how biased have I become? Away from my resolve, mindless, by the planes of the outskirts of my inferential know. See, this is a bit tawny—as it were—a mix of the brown and the yellow. Figuring out <i> what is what? </i> Am I the brown? Is that what I would have volitionally willed? My propensity? Or am I the yellow, the obvious? Or still, am I somewhere in there, in the discrete, lost in the composition, forever lost in the world of labels, caught away in a colour? To figure these things out, I’ll need to understand this concept—Curse of Knowledge—and how I can better delineate who I am, or at least, what I choose to stand for, what counts for an improvement, and what sits as corruption, knowing there is a normal psychology of belief that allows for outside influences.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Body on heads, still my skin is dry and ugly. Head over body, still I count a twine at its turns. I’m sick and I can get no help, still I’m my help. Body on heads. I’ll keep safe.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Thinking of it; all the trouble I go through during the day. The only time I’m ever down or sad at my existence is when I wake up. Waking up in a ditch-bed, a subtle strong reminder of remiss; waking up from mortal <i> sleep</i>  after I took that cup of shaving powder that should have ended this existence. The after fact of my inability to down it when I should have, quite early, following its preparation, part hunts me every morning. A reinitiation into the turmoils of my life here need not be beard, I’m tired, and a misuse of an opportunity is light of cowardice. These things should be written, reread, understood, so in the relapse to the phase of not being able to endanger the existence that holds bare in a life of wondrous things, I’ll pull off my tie, say I fought a good one, and all things like my life, must come to an end.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Sometimes hackneyed words are meant. Regardless you should always call people on their bullshit.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         An excerpt from the course on Skepticism: <i> Once we have an idea in our minds about something, we notice only evidence that confirms the idea and are blind to evidence that disconfirms it.</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         The intentions behind this entry are frazzled and worn out, reason, I have spoken on them countless times. My mum is sick and I think it’s born out of a loss of a lot, I can’t begin to list them all, but one idea would be a neglect of what is important.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Most audiobooks are just filled with cynicism.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Just thinking of this same audiobook, it has me thinking how in the undulation of history, a lot of books are lost in the tides of history, never to make it to the halls of the classic.

I guess this is mine, I took half a pill earlier this morning to sleep, took the other this morning after breakfast, I guess that’s why I’m this way. It’s 3:05 PM. I guess I’ll be filling my responsibilities. This morning was exciting, so I was on twitter, woke up around 2:03 A.M, and loading up twitter, with three minutes in, Jessica’s account records an activity, and I used the opportunity to post my Haikus. In minutes, she tweets saying something about, being about it. Here is the tweet: <i> don’t say it if you don’t fucking mean it.</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         I was a bit confounded, thought of it a while. Do I post something, saying I tried to taper off the effect of my honest words? But then I’d be insecure all my life if I did that, I didn’t post anything. I took my mind off it, surfed YouTube a while. I later switched tabs, and saw she posted a picture, one of a couple or a date pair at a table having ice-cream from a goblet in a saucer, on closer look-up I realized it’s a shot from a 2001 movie called <i> Serendipity</i> . I downloaded, but it isn’t complete yet. Well, what I guess is, the former tweet wasn’t for me. I guess she meant it for someone else. I’ll guess she’d rather have us go out on that kinda date than a cinema. My post might be off a bit, it’s because I’m just somewhere, lol.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         I’m adding this entry as a means, a reminder; a way of getting back to this important statement from the composer Felix Mendelssohn on the debate of music and its nature of meaning, it says: <i> What the music I love expresses to me is not thought too indefinite to put to words but too definite to put to words</i> . This sentiment flies in the face of those who have declared that music is too abstract to have an actual meaning, what the narrator ensues from this is <i> if a piece moves you in a certain way, brings to mind certain images or stories, it doesn’t matter if what you’re interpreting is what was intended, if it gives you what the incident might call many feels, it means what it means</i> .</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         This input is important for reasons that don’t necessary matter to me, but still will be elucidated in full for its pleasure; disambiguation. The name Wiayu and its connote is now a thing for folks, apart from the fact that it’s a song by Skrillex and Diplo feat Justin Bieber off of the Jack U album, the album that says instead of doing drugs, why not do some Jack U - listen to the album - is now used in certain circles as a taboo word. Just this morning I called my friend and he refused to reply me when I asked where he was, pretending not to hear me, this isn’t the first time, it’s been of incidence. My only reason for calling this out, is my stumbling on the concept of Diffeomorphism Invariance, meaning <i> what’s going on at a point in space depends only on that point, and not where it’s located, nor what’s happening at other points</i> . This might not necessarily tie things together directly, but from a cognition level in lieu of the former, I’d like this post to remain as a reference. Bear in mind that Diffeomorphism Invariance is based on the concept of Loop Quantum Gravity and this, has no confirming data.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         I need to reboot my devotional, I mean living the maxims, whether it calls me out, admonishes or advises me.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         So in a lecture about loop quantum gravity, Dr Don Lincoln is wearing a shirt with Einstein on it with his tongue out and his left eyebrow looking avian like, its plain funny. </p>\n\n    <p> </p><p> </p>"

Suffer not the fashonable Fools to depress your powers by the prices they pretend to give for contemptible works, or the expensive advertizing boasts that they make of such works; believe Christ &amp; his Apostles that there is a Class of Men whose whole delight is in Destroying. We do not want either Greek or Roman Models if we are but just &amp; true to our own Imaginations, those Worlds of Eternity in which we shall live for ever in JESUS OUR LORD.</i> </p>\n<p> </p>\n    <p>         I’ve been reading the book on Stoicism by the same author of my Daily devotional, <i> The Stoic Challenge - William B. Irvine</i> . And I found this important point referenced from a book been spoken about, it’s called <i> On Death and Dying by Elisabeth KüblerRoss </i> and here it is quoted: <i> The five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and finally, acceptance. These were the stages, she said, that those diagnosed with a terminal illness typically go through—and the stages that these individuals should go through to effectively deal with grief. </i> I’ll be downloading this book, dealing with the voices, I feel like I’ve gone through these stages, in order to get a more nuanced healing; understanding, I’ll be getting this book.</p>\n\n    <p> </p><p> </p>"

Fundamentally the persona is nothing real: it is a compromise between individual and society as to what a man should appear to be . . . The persona is a semblance, a two-dimensional reality, to give it a nickname.</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         A psychological instrument in the Stoic tool kit is <strong>negative visualization</strong>. It’s imperative involves making a point of imagining ways in which my life could be worse. It is important to realize that in advising me to negatively visualize, the Stoics aren’t advocating that I dwell on how things could be worse; that would indeed be a recipe for misery. Instead, what I should do is periodically have flickering thoughts about how my life and circumstance could be worse.</p>\n\n    <p> </p><p> </p>"

In reality, these laws are better classified as principles, which are true most of the time. However, the term law has stuck with these principles because they were established so long ago. So we will continue to refer to them as laws, even though technically they are not scientific laws.</i> </p>\n<p> </p>\n    <p>         From an article on Gestalt psychology: <i> Gestalt psychologists argued that these principles exist because the mind has an </i> <strong><i> innate disposition to perceive patterns in the stimulus</i> </strong><i>  based on certain rules. These principles are organized into categories including: </i> <strong><i> Proximity</i> </strong><i> , </i> <strong><i> Similarity</i> </strong><i> , </i> <strong><i> Continuity</i> </strong><i> , </i> <strong><i> Closure</i> </strong><i> , </i> <strong><i> Common Region</i> </strong><i> , and </i> <strong><i> Connectedness</i> </strong><i> .</i>  I’m breaking down the <strong>principle of continuity</strong> for lack of an innate understanding of its workings.<i>  The law of continuity is a </i> <strong><i> heuristic principle</i> </strong><i>  introduced by Gottfried Leibniz based on earlier work by Nicholas of Cusa and Johannes Kepler. It is the principle that \"</i> <strong><i> whatever succeeds for the finite, also succeeds for the infinite</i> </strong><i> \". Kepler used The Law of Continuity to calculate the area of the circle by representing the latter as an infinite-sided polygon with infinitesimal sides, and adding the areas of infinitely-many triangles with infinitesimal bases. Leibniz used the principle to extend concepts such as arithmetic operations, from ordinary numbers to infinitesimals, laying the groundwork for infinitesimal calculus. A mathematical implementation of the law of continuity is provided by the transfer principle in the context of the hyperreal numbers. A related law of continuity concerning intersection numbers in geometry was promoted by Jean-Victor Poncelet in his \"Traité des propriétés projectives des figures\".</i> </p>\n<p> </p>\n    <p>         Kindly note that some of these principles can sometimes lead to incorrect perceptions of the world. It is important to remember that while these principles are referred to as laws of perceptual organization, they are actually heuristics or short-cuts. Heuristics are usually designed for speed, which is why our perceptual systems sometimes make mistakes and we experience perceptual inaccuracies.</p>\n\n    <p> </p><p> </p>"

Despite the fashionable nonsense, especially in the United States, about “self-made men” (they are usually men), there actually is no such thing. Without social bonds and support our lives would be, as Thomas Hobbes famously put it, poor, nasty, brutish, and short. The second bit, the one about intelligence, does not mean that we always, or even often, act rationally. Only that </i> <strong><i> we have the capability to do so</i> </strong><i> .</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         <i> Ethics, then, especially (but not only) for the Stoics becomes a matter of “</i> <strong><i> living according to nature</i> </strong><i> ,” meaning not to endorse whatever is natural (that’s an elementary logical fallacy), but rather t</i> <strong><i> o take seriously the two pillars of human nature</i> </strong><i> : </i> <strong><i> sociality</i> </strong><i>  and </i> <strong><i> reason</i> </strong><i> . As Marcus Aurelius put it, “Do what is necessary, and whatever the reason of a social animal naturally requires, and as it requires.” (Meditations, IV.24)</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>            <i> There is something, of course, the ancients did get wrong: they, especially Aristotle, thought that </i> <strong><i> human nature was the result of a teleological process</i> </strong><i> , that everything has a proper function, determined by the very nature of the cosmos. We don’t believe that anymore, not after Copernicus and especially Darwin. But we do know that </i> <strong><i> human beings are indeed a particular product of complex and ongoing evolutionary processes</i> </strong><i> . These processes do not determine a human essence, but they do </i> <strong><i> shape a statistical cluster of characters that define what it means to be human</i> </strong><i> . That cluster, in turn, </i> <strong><i> constrains </i> </strong><i> — </i> <strong><i> without determining</i> </strong><i>  — what sort of behaviors are pro-social and lead to human flourishing, and what sort of behaviors don’t.

I wake up twenty-five minutes ago with lingering night visions, I’m in a trap-house smoking hard drugs, It’s a very hostile environment. The dream isn’t very vivid, far from eidetic, but there are fragments of images left, I’ll be recording them in the <i> night vision </i> bar. I haven’t recorded any in a while now, it’s strictly a thing of laziness, as I have stopped smoking weed—nothing holding me back—making them commonplace in my mornings.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         It’s a sad narrative, what my life will be if I don’t take charge of my story, I have been away from my journal, and my daily rituals, only having access to my devotional through a mobile phone, a device with enough problems of its own. The reason for this input is to draw attention to the last day’s entry; a poem from Maya Angelou, where I mistook the title of <i> Accident </i> for <i> Tonight</i> .</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         The word <i> accident </i> has been used on several occasions to describe the psychological phenomenon of psychosis, this being a repetitive occurrence in the constant jabberwocky assault. I have chosen not to record any of it in my journal as the nomenclature of the “game-mind” is something I have chosen not to dabble with as I thought it was unnecessary. Moving forward I think in my leisure time, I’ll be doing a disambiguation of the terms, stating clearly what I infer from the commonly used words, phrases and even some of the concepts and what I should, saving my cognition any hampering to its workings. I must admit in shame that I wish not to take on this.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Drawing from the last input, my words on the nomenclature of the perceived “game-mind”. The word <i> Ajebutter</i>  and its origin, based on what I know from a google search; it meaning a brand of butter sold to the <i> elite </i> and also what it stands for now: a superior race or class of Yorubas. Ah, so funny. To me, all I see it as, is a weak way of hiding the frailty of the inability of a people to deal with their insecurities, their shortcomings, an almost waning whine of defeat at something so rudimentary and important. It begs the question: what makes for a civilized society?</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         I despise my choice of words and attempts at marshalling my train of thoughts. I have been away too long from journaling, it has affected my spewing, my dexterity, my austerity, my formality and audacity, crippling my eloquent demeanour of perceived “<i> compelling</i> ”.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Will it take my own death to be cognizant of my own life, my life as a whole?</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Jessica posted a song it’s called May 1<sup>st</sup> by Beach Fossils, after listening I decided to search for a song of May 23<sup>rd</sup> since May 1<sup>st</sup> is hers. It returned a couple of results and I went with the first entry in the song bar, it was a piano <i> fingering</i> . After listening, I scrolled down and found a podcast entry in its section, I decided to look it up as its name is interesting, it’s titled The Left Right Game.    </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>Downloading and listening, as I have just started, barely three full minutes in as I type in this entry, it starts with an auto-crash of the protagonist, I guess. He is bedridden, his doctor comes in as he’d been out up until now. He’s taking notes and he ask what day it is . . . It’s <i> Friday, erm . . .</i>  It’s Friday today and I didn’t know it was Thursday up until late yesterday night. Another thing of interest is my last tweet, on which says Tawny and Beige no archives @itsjessandrea &lt;put smiling face smiley here&gt;. Next thing I’m on Charli XCX’s Instagram page and it’s the day—Thursday—she’s having her Live remote show and it’s no archives—she isn’t archiving, no replays fam— and the first clip on her story’s timeline is from a fan, some <i> Beigesandal</i> . Okay . . . I’m not into Pythagorean and all but hey! That hella makes me feel good . . . oh, oh not forgetting that In my freestyle the one I sent to Jessica last, where I discovered the phrase “keep unlocking my beige”, there is another where I say “why I gotta go out of my way just to let you feel how I feel.” Her latest album she threw a listening party for—How I’m feeling now. And the cream to the coffee . . . Yes, the <i> protagonist </i> had an accident, the last poem form Maya Angelou in my daily entry is <i> accident</i> . The one mistaken for tonight. It’s all a bit vague but it’s a fine ball of strings.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         An excerpt from my reading of today of the course on Skepticism: In his book Immortality: <i> The Quest to Live Forever and How It Drives Civilization, the British philosopher Stephen Cave calls this the mortality paradox: “Death presents itself as both inevitable and impossible,” he suggests. We see it all around us, yet “it involves the end of consciousness, and we cannot consciously simulate what it is like to not be conscious.”</i>  isn’t life a beautiful paradox. An almost wanton enigma, depends on where you look at it from.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Another excerpt paraphrased is: <i> Given that our normal experience is of stimuli coming into the brain from the outside, when a part of the brain abnormally generates hallucinations caused by another part of the brain; low activity in the posterior superior parietal lobe, a region of the brain authors have dubbed the orientation association area (OAA) —quite possibly the left-hemisphere interpreter described by neuroscientist Michael Gazzaniga—interprets them as external events. Hence, the abnormal is interpreted as supernormal.</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         <i> A final piece of evidence comes from research by neuroscientists who have now documented that in the brains of people undergoing hallucinations, the same sensory perceptual systems become active </i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p><i> as those engaged in the sensation of actual physical stimulation. As the great neurologist Dr. Oliver Sacks notes in his many remarkable books, all such experiences reside in the brain, not in the world.</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p><i> Belief in the afterlife is a type of dualism. Because we are natural-born dualists who intuitively believe that our minds are separate from our brains and bodies, the afterlife is the logical step in projecting our own mind-agency into the future without our bodies.</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         An excerpt from the last chapter:<i>  Even with all these precautions in place, any of us may end up believing weird things, even while being rational and scientific in other areas of our lives. The reason for this has to do with what we might call logic-tight compartments—modules in the brain analogous to watertight compartments in a ship. The existence of compartmentalized brain functions, acting in either concert or conflict, has been a core idea of evolutionary psychology since the 1990s. According to University of Pennsylvania evolutionary psychologist Robert Kurzban, the brain evolved as a modular, multitasking, problem-solving organ—a Swiss army knife of practical tools. There is no unified “self” that generates internally consistent and seamlessly coherent beliefs. Instead, we are a collection of distinct but interacting modules that are often at odds with one another.</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>Some quotes:</p>\n\n    <p><br/></p>\n\n    <p><strong>Carl Sagan</strong> <i> Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i>  </i> </p>\n\n    <p><strong>Christopher Hitchens</strong> <i> What can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence.</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i>  </i> </p>\n\n    <p><strong>David Hume’s </strong><i> A wise man proportions his belief to the evidence.</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i>  </i> </p>\n\n    <p><strong>Skeptic Motto </strong><i> I don’t know.” We don’t have to have an explanation for everything.</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i>  </i> </p>\n\n    <p><strong>Isaac Asimov </strong><i> When people thought the Earth was flat, they were wrong.

It’s the normal spirit in the air, the same theme of all my previous, or better said, my recent last visits to the trap house; “the lack of resource”, “inability to pacify cravings” not on my end at least. My last visits have been more of “reasons not to come around”, “why it’s definite, my quitting”. Derailing from the vision, it’s now a known fact, at least from recent reactions, that my visits to places like Ota stir up visions of drug use in my dreams, this solely being that my only reason for going there have been to get drugs, now my street is filled with drug addicts, even if I don’t see them doing it, I know better, besides my initials read O.T.A, that is Ogundipe Theophilus Ademola. I should know the town well you would think.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Continuing my vision, I’m in the trap-house and I turn out a new “product”, I unwrap it and it’s big, almost too big—it’s a dream so I guess it all makes sense— I’m thinking to myself as I write this how alive I am. Fuck, it’s so surreal and I miss Jessica, I don’t know words to say to her but I want to shout it out that I love her, and I will next time I’m online, even if it sounds stupid. Back to the night vision, a whole paragraph wasted.</p>\n\n    <p> </p>\n\n    <p>         Okay, so I turn it out and I’m really selfish with it, all these boys want it more than I do, ready to roll heads. Well, I wasn’t allowed to smoke it on dividing it, I give half to someone—I think—and I try smoking the other, but I receive a pinch to my back and it all became a joke, like hey why am I being so selfish with this, it isn’t even worth anything, just another way of destroying this good God giving life.</p>\n\n    <p> </p><p> </p>"

What’s driven for this post is the pellucid serendipity—actually the two listeners who sent a mail, requesting to have these subjects reviewed; that is: Indianapolis, and Love at first sight. Listening to the first topic in reviewal, I could not but try to ebb back my thoughts from cascading in a domino of plausible events in the life of I and my love. Him talking about his lawn, and I thinking of my dread for laborious activities, but not willing to pass the buck if it means losing my girl. Yes, I know it’s a bit tripe, but enough of that. What’s mind boggling here is the fact that Indianapolis was suggested by Jessie, and love at first sight was suggested by Theo, huh? <strong>Jessie</strong> and <strong>Theo</strong>, really that’s some oddity, of all episodes, of all names? Okay, I guess I’m growing, I’m hearing voices, and now the world is some beautiful odyssey where I get my girl and we live forever after if I make the right choices.

I heard so many voices listening to a song this morning, it was saddening, but I do it for me, not for anyone. The voices I guess keeps my inner-dialogue, and reminds me there is much to behaviour than self-talk.</p>\n<p> </p>\n    <p>Here is the message I sent to Jessica yesterday:</p>\n<p> </p>\n    <p><i> Can you save my heavy dirty soul from me? how's your day been?</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i> So here is what happened . . . Last week Tuesday I was away to a neighbouring state, it's called Osun, I was posted there for the NYSC program years back, it starts with a 3 weeks compound camping, after which I'm dispatched to a local district for a year program, but first I was to go home, take care of my needs. On getting back to Lagos before leaving for my house, I receive a phone call from my friend informing me on how he still needs me to come see him, we'd been talking for a while about me coming to spend time around. I arrive at his place; he resides in a hotel—he's from outside the state. I was with him a while, when I inform him on the program I was writing then, it's a publishing platform software, I had zipped a copy of it on my phone, it being the only thing I thought of all through the camping. He was happy and bit surprised to know I had started writing programs—we had been crack-buddies, tinkering with paid software back in uni. He informs me of a colleague who is currently working on a startup—we graduated the previous year—and how he's going in as a tech assistant, he implores me to join the train so I do. I sat in for the interview, and got employed. Few months in, the man—the colleague's uncle—wants me to work on the publishing platform for him. Two years later, I'm working with a startup I co-founded, and the NYSC program is totally out of view, it being the single program I need to get employed in the country. It was a total blow off. On quitting my startup due to the insidious effect of daily weed smoking and a new growing two, three months habit of crack, I decided to quit, on seeing my inability to stay away. Better to cut my money supply I thought. I had stayed clean for months, but working on a mixtape and having friends who smoked, popped pills, I never was a popper, it was difficult, and hey there had been some cool songs on staying sober, like Dance to this by Troye Sivan. lol.</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i> On coming home, I had some new gigs, but I lost them all because my dad promised I was going for a Master’s program in Dubai, I couldn't 'cause I guess he tricked me, I don't trust him. I'm back, was supposed to leave for USA then the pandemic hits, what a crease. Here is the reason why I left for Osun to ascertain the state of the NYSC program. </i> </p>\n\n    <p><i> In my freestyle I said something about being locked up with still no serving, I had no idea I said that at the time, my thoughts betray me always, sad. </i> </p>\n\n    <p><i> The dudes in the state; the officers in charge of the re-mobilization program, had me pay back the allowances I got paid, two months before I absconded, why you may say? Because it was much of a strife for my comfortable lifestyle *coughs*. I just couldn't take the ride down, it was hours, but that wasn't it. I had been betrayed by my work colleagues on my last travel, my software had been pitched in the weekly weekend meetings. In perspective, it was what I interviewed with, I showed the \"colleague's\" uncle. It just wasn't fair to be treated that way. Meeting him, confronting him stating clearly that it was intellectual theft to have the company build a software I had started, being younger then and, naive I couldn't get into a proper deal with him, I settled for you'll be fine, and there was a great recording studio, a medium state of the art sorta, and I lived on premises, so I got opportunities to practice, though I never got to, I was way too busy writing the program.</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i> Well, these folks are weird you know, he has me leave with the original copy of the issued receipt and, honestly I just knew something was off, his motions betrayed him, but hey why read meanings to things right? On getting back home I get into a I'm not down for this conversation with my dad and mail the PR section of the program, asking to be informed on what I was to do with the receipts, I had been told by the accountant to expect a call and a text message, this being the traditional way of announcements. It was some weird correspondence being I'd take on a more stilted approach with my word use. Nothing serious just a call of attention to the CC marker.</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i> He sends me a message on Monday saying I was saying nonsense; sending messages to offices I had no business. All I did was follow instructions, on sending a request for publicly needed information, I was told to follow a link to complete my registration, I got a notification response stating my ineligibility to use the application and to report it to the state office, which I did.</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i> The awful thing is, now I have to travel again, to submit the papers. Whose fault is that? Maybe mine for not being all knowing. </i> </p>\n\n    <p><i> That's pretty much it.</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p><p> </p>"

I guess I didn't . . . I have no idea lol. Jess, I'm not happy. Though nothing could be more excitingly sputtering right now than this little \"out of my reality grip\" thing you've got going. Remember when I said \"How can lies be cues if truth is but an impression, what am I missing?\" Yesterday I was by myself. Not really, I never am, it's a bypass usually to articulate my thoughts as close as my frayed, exhausted brain would let me. But yesterday I got to it—I still get to do things lol—and it precipitated up, through all those strands of drenched neurons soaked up in Jess' mirth, and I got it, Now I can't remember, you know why? I figured you understand. The crux of this message is to ascertain, yes you see my messages, oooh he's still on that . . . well what else? No funeral at this ending.

I don’t really see the difference. We find ourselves through the process of escaping. It is not where we are, but where we want to go, and all that. ‘Is there no way out of the mind?’ Sylvia Path famously asked. I had been interested in this question (what it meant, what the answers might be) ever since I had come across it as a teenager in a book of quotations. If there is a way out, a way that isn’t death itself, then the exit route is through words. But rather than leave the mind entirely, words help us leave a mind, and give us the building blocks to build another one, similar but better, nearby to the old one but with firmer foundations, and very often a better view.</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i> So the fact that this book exists is proof that depression lies. Depression makes you think things that are wrong.</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i>  </i> </p>\n\n    <p><i> I know, I know, we are humans. We are a clandestine species. Unlike other animals we wear clothes and do our procreating behind closed doors. And we are ashamed when things go wrong with us. But we’ll grow out of this, and the way we’ll do it is by speaking about it. And maybe even through reading and writing about it.</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i>  </i> </p>\n\n    <p><i> Depression looks different to everyone. Pain is felt in different ways, to different degrees, and provokes different responses. That said, if books had to replicate our exact experience of the world to be useful, the only books worth reading would be written by ourselves.</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i>  </i> </p>\n\n    <p><i> Unlike a book or a film depression doesn’t have to be about something.</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i>  </i> </p>\n\n    <p><i> It is said that insanity is a logical response to an insane world. Maybe depression is in part simply a response to a life we don’t really understand. Of course, no one understands their life completely if they think about it. An annoying thing about depression is that thinking about life is inevitable. Depression makes thinkers out of all of us. Just ask Abraham Lincoln.</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i>  </i> </p>\n\n    <p><i> Hovering over what? According to Albert Camus, is the only serious question human beings have to deal with.</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i>  </i> </p>\n\n    <p><i> Fear makes us curious. Sadness makes us philosophise.</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i>  </i> </p>\n\n    <p><i> To be calm becomes a kind of revolutionary act. To be happy with your own non-upgraded existence.</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i>  </i> </p>\n\n    <p><i> Life lesson: the way out is never through yourself.</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i>  </i> </p>\n\n    <p><i> Sometimes on the rocky, windy path of recovery, what feels like failure can be a step forward.</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i>  </i> </p>\n\n    <p><i> Do you not see how necessary a world of pains and troubles is to school an intelligence and make it a soul?</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i>  </i> </p>\n\n    <p><i> You need to feel life’s terror to feel its wonder.</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i>  </i> </p>\n\n    <p><i> … and I am glad for the synesthesia that means when I read Emily Dickinson or Mark Twain my mind feels actual warmth from those old American words.</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i>  </i> </p>\n\n    <p><i> How to stop time: kiss.</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i> How to travel in time: read.</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i> How to escape time: music.</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i> How to feel time: write.</i> </p>\n\n    <p><i> How to release time: breathe.</i> </p>\n\n    <p> </p><p> </p>"

    <p>         A sigh of relief. A bit of luck on your side, I prefer karma on my side, I’m back to my journal, it’s a new year, and it couldn’t have had a better ringing; a connotation of <i> never losing myself. </i> A month ago, I inscribed in black ASCII characters, the intention of moving forward alone. A month of playing <i> hop and grab</i>  at the cookie off the dangling line fastened to a cane. I guess I’m not good enough, I will be, there are materials I need to cover. After being swooned head over heels, it’s only creative to in style space this one out, leaving it where it ends substantively, its place in the continuum of my life.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         All I need today, every day is the knowledge of the value of my own existence, its acknowledgeable forebear, the antecedence that has made it possible for me to be here. The prodding of the anonymous plays only the role of <i> reminder</i> . These reminders of my personal worth will sash me up, being attributive prerogatives in dealing with life normativity.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>         An excerpt from my current read, Music, and the Mind by Anthony Storr: <i> Bird songs resemble human music both in the sound patterns and in the behaviour setting. Songs illustrate the aesthetic mean between chaotic irregularity and monotonous regularity . . . The essential difference from human music is in the brief temporal span of the bird’s repeatable patterns, commonly three seconds or less, with an upper limit of about fifteen seconds. This limitation conforms to the concept of primitive musicality. Every simple musical device, even transposition and simultaneous harmony, occurs in bird music.</i> </p>

    <p><span class="dropcap text-dark">A</span><p>lot strikes a man as important, and poignant during his lifetime. When I was a kid, it was my female desk partner in the classroom who stroked my thighs a lot. We sat in the front row, she wore a very short gown, refused to recite the national anthem on the morning assembly ground, and her excuses? For the gown, her parents couldn’t afford to replace her old, now skimpy ones. And as to her indifference to the patriotic solemnity? She threw it out as incompatible with her religious faith, she was a Jehovah Witness, and I was seven years old. I didn’t get it; prescription was all I knew. Publications like The Watchtower and Awake! helped me growing up. They were my major source of information about the international world, grew my love for nature, and science, and brought to my hands, exemplars in the local scene doing Jehovah’s work.</p>

    <p>         It kept on happening, she touched me for pleasure, just my thighs, but I never touched her. Her chocolate brown skin, lissom neck, slit eyes, and calming voice were just that; of a soon-to-be-replaced desk mate. I once suffered a mean male mate; he stabbed my palm with a pencil. It is a hotchpotch of history from a time Leonor, Princess of Asturias was still to be birth, amazing titbit.</p>

    <p>         My teenage years made me understand I needed more ways to navigate life. With my grandma visiting, and mum seeing her off, I was distracted from a sentimental bye to her, with a call to the environment, of how it could use some cleaning. In some hurry or sheer uninterest, I informed her, the outdoor broom was missing, it undoubtedly was, and it usually didn't take a long search to find it. She at the instance, convinced me it wasn’t a bad idea to use the indoor one to get the chore completed. I did and faced the music, nothing less, I got punished, and it stuck. For me, it was high-up injustice. I followed the instructions given and cleaned the ground. I’m happy to fill the dark and unnoticed, the bristles were soft and it made the chore a breeze.</p>

    <p>         I just hated that I couldn’t talk to anyone, the elders were mean and did whatever pleased them, and there wasn’t a sure way to track the importance of antecedence. Nothing made much sense so I turned to text, good ones always gave the hand of friendship, and it wasn’t much of playing with the older, when I told my biological dad, one day on a drive to my university, I was sixteen, that I find it hard to commit to mind, things I can’t grasp structurally. I can’t cram, he thought I meant</p>

    <p>         At twenty-one, when weed got hip, I'd had friends who enjoyed it when I was eighteen, but they were friends because we shared the same university hall. Smoke up my lungs at the time, felt too far removed from the boy who watched that one man in the <i>recreation club</i>, who is friends with my biological dad, who'd fling cigarettes’ butts without a stub. I’d watch him, pick it up, go into the dark, and pray for a glow. I never got one, or maybe it was the dispelling tobacco smell. The ash also was unpleasant. But I had a man who helped in menial jobs, whose son came around a couple of times, to help put me out of my misery. He came with nothing but left with a good smoke. A paper and a matchbox, that was all, we smoked paper, but it didn’t leave me still wanting to smoke, I coughed, there was too much smoke, and the desire had met its satiety.</p>

    <p>         So twenty-one, I ingested a lot of weed, still frowning at inhaling smoke. When I did, it was uneventful, but for pictures and the pipe used, and my Armani shirt. It was lacklustre, my best days of high were behind me, but I smoked a lot from then on.</p>

    <p>         Losing sense of my table, and drifting for a brief moment. Having just looked back through the stack of files I had recently updated to make sense of the last written line of code, coming to hate the distraction the substance provided in parallel suggestions, I knew it was time to call it quits. I did, and in less than three months, got the job on my hands completed. I enjoyed being sober for a while, and started a mixtape, and swore to never go back to my habitual weed smoking, and since I had smoked crack-cocaine a couple of times, and to be very certain I would be going through with this clean episode of efficaciousness, and abstinence, on the mixtape, I declared and presented myself as a habitual drug user in recovery. It helped me, because it took me off of everyone’s radar. Somehow, their eyes weren’t the judging ends, very few would be aware of whatever was happening in my life, only close associates, friends, and family.</p>

    <p>         Before my declaration, I had become friends with Brian Rose, the host of London Real on Facebook. I sent him a cover of a song I had made, <i>Moonlight by XXXTentacion</i>. He thought the beat was nice. I was very unimpressed at his only admiration for the beat. Weeks earlier, he had encouraged me, along with a group to record a video introduction presenting ourselves, he said it would put us in a position of accountability. I saw a few faces in the group and gave up. Oh, I couldn’t do this. Another time, in a live-video class, he offered to break down my business, a music-streaming platform, as an example for the class, so I went offline. Oh, it was just a bore, I won't be able to take the information in, I told myself. They were actual human beings, I'd need to sell my products to, but my self-confidence was in tatters.</p>

    <p>         Something had to change, I had to understand what I was doing smoking weed every night, all mornings before nine, and in between breaks when finally, I had the office all to myself. I remember telling the drug dealer I needed something stronger, a more potent strain I had told him. I could afford a better drug if it was what I wanted, but it wasn’t. I was a lonely busy young man, on an uphill battle for a steady income, with problems very personal, as writing a software program, which only shows up more holes to fit, needing a change in the blueprint.</p>

    <p>         When I told the drug dealer, I’d smoked crack a couple of times, he told me he took sleeping pills in the past, but thanks to his mum, he only smokes weed and drinks beer now, as it almost ruined him. His girlfriend could help me get some was his response, he called me a professor, admired me, and told me to avoid crack, but not in any way alarming. It is fine to say he didn’t directly, but through allusion, I guess a silence pervaded the place in abjection, whispering the obvious. I left that town still owing him, we met shortly after the debt but never discussed it, only I knew I had to pay him. I had gotten more money than usual one night from a client and he threw his weight in, helping with a filler sum for the supply to counteract my frozen bank account.</p>

    <p>         A sort of race had started, I was either racing to penance or handshakes from the real users. I discovered the dealer’s delivery man had been ripping me off and followed him to the drug house, it is there some well-dressed fellow shook my hand like I had just ruined my life, depending on how you look at it. It hurt back in my well lit, clean office. My use lasted for a few days because I smoked a lot at once. When the month ended, the first month of relapse, with a track on the mixtape reading <i>Better off the drugs</i>, it was clear what the news was, I was about to become an addict.</p>

    <p>         I resigned at the end of the month, said no to opportunities that would keep my pocket fat, and moved back home. Back with my biological parents, I donned rags instead of casual clothing. There was a shame I couldn’t blot off, and I needed someone to talk to me. I spoke to myself, read books, and took myself more seriously. Started a journal, and partook in compulsory morning rituals. Soon I was clean finally, the year is 2020, my year of growth. Several times I had typed the letters, Vision2020 in the password box, pondering its other significance, outside of my knowledge of its pop reference to Justin Timberlake’s album, and visual acuity. The year was 2017, I had no plans for the year outside of my job, but I desperately wanted a life worth living, so to speak, another password. The real sobriety battle started August 31, 2018 after my resignation.</p>

    <p>         My road to writing poetry fills these pages. I somewhere found my voice again. I share this journal as it is, to show the other sap I live through. It is self-improvement. There are personal notes and recorded knowledge from my numerous readings. They’ve brought me this far, nothing compares to the personal time, we spend with ourselves. I am glad I had these special moments recorded.</p>

    <p>         2019, was a tough year, another relapse worse than I could imagine, it lasted a few days, less than two weeks, and it taught me something. A familiar voice finally started speaking. But it had not brought an intervention, it dismissed philosophy in a fashion dissimilar to ignorance, as not the answer, to acquaint with heroin. It seemed to suggest madness. The actions that led to this journal saved me. In my head was some other friend who fought to live as my activities grew and so did my knowledge, helping him rest easy.</p>
