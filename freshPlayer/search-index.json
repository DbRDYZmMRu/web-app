        "chapterTextContent": "How did we give up To meeting in the real world?  From our last days in the halls To my bedroom’s nooky spot.  In there, we had the braid 1101 bun Racking stature every o’clock shore Patching new again my shudder fur.  I for one stopped In tracks on spurs To listen, stunned By a geek’s Red love.  Meets in the shower room to shop And po-faced Adam’s frame’s drub Home, he was choirmaster, conductor And everything I could touch, I bought.  I would love to sing, strew tunes forth They say I own a voice, a bit of flavour But not how they sing any good songs.  And on, long on, he would teach, bare butt.  Your old songs are no good, very immature It’s time you’re serious and pen new ones.  He hadn’t heard any, but gave his opinion It had me embarrassed from my own hunch Having written so little in years, then stopped It expired my little jotters, and my best chorus My favourite line remains like fine wine stored.  And paints my world in a little rainbow . . . Only love.  The tune came from a white film, a romcom The scene had snow, so white it is dubbed The theme song had stirred my emotions The tele place so far, but still within touch I had no worries then, but a song addition So I wrote Only love for the still far future To my dutch.  But a few years later brought me transition Too young for the old “wedding” thoughts “Too old” for Only love and now impervious Meaning my new jotter holds a quiet edition.  Adam sang exceptionally, but was not serious He’d written no songs, but replicated scores His music playlist though was a real junction.  The first Taylor Swift fan told me I’m a bore So I never listened to Red or followed the cult Instead, I chewed his bits and dibs on Red’s cud.  Time passed and Facebook became passport Everywhere but there, there was a withdraw I started weed, and I wrote a lot on my wall The summer I was too musical, but no Taylor Then it happened, the 1989 album dropped!  I met you, Teacher, it was the best welcome It is sick! The beat on Welcome To New York  How I started my mornings, screen sessions Then like a para-influence, my very first o’clock And another, and yet again in a mood summon.  I told myself, I’d awoken in a “virtual” simulation Of my brain being alive, the reconciliatory factor The best thing from looking for nothing at all.  A calm hit me, with few months to graduation With Owl City and Aloe Blacc’s congratulations It declared all: clocks on necks ticking on a run Out on the edge for the rest of our lives. Period.  Everything changed for me at 1989’s airport But I did not rush into Taylor Swift’s nation At least not immediately, I had a cart to fill up So I picked the Voice Memos in the collection Hearing you play, learning, developing a bond.  A hundred and eighty songs to track were fun I credit you Teacher for the mighty turn around And your Taylor insignia on every beat dump!  It was a dream, and now it’s reality in perception Unbelievable, I think I write songs? I write pop!  I and Adam’s relationship later fell off He knew my girlfriends, all that botch We talked music, it’s a lot we discussed And there was bad advice for me to trust.  He’d lent me money to get ostentatious She didn’t need or ask for the high storm But it felt good sending her the big sum It’s my whole month’s allowance she got For her birthday, but come mine she forgot.  Her reprise back to me, whacked and it hurt With the typical, daily calls and discussion Not seeing mine, not bothering with a call For my birthday, for its date, not one fuss So I called that one off and picked a crutch.  Time came to payback for the mis-venture And I did, like any debt, forgetting the loss Here is where Adam showed me his disgust.  His claim was I have a voodooish purse And money I paid to him had dissolved Right into thin air, in dark imagination I’d have to pay what I owe, no witch hunt.",

If familiar with Coldplay, to and listened: The tod ruler of that old clatty world Who sweeps now, the streets he owned.   Of all my stored gifts and paraphernalia My favourite is an old tawdry black band Mayhap, slack from stones in its past hold.   We used to be a pack with the lights, spelled grand And to the outside world, everything, remove bland Recoil; another recon, it all made for spangle, clang!  And there was my Janice. . . . then Janice came in. The truce to our huddling!  First, on a close sheila's page We met . . . By my account, a we case.   Flecks on her bosom that displaced What whom knows, how got braced Mistaken for vitiligo scattered heys.  Knocking for the seltzer Taste, exquisite Too, slat With bibbed cantrip heel pace Strewn as every follower in cadge ache  Scrolling unto another shake.   Come another day Was here to her name And another . . .  Innumerable merry dates Till I was in for all her fame.   Her mincing in were like that in heels Likening irony of a sprocket's teeth Nonslack was her hold on me and clear The whittling of our ingot agreement Left me enervate in ground bare tears.  The much: on another's touch.   And he did touch, all too very much Caught on camera, to say my fudge Loaded to me, through me, surged.   Laying tears, eying . . . Does the indelible tideline Back sulkier.   I think I am . . . Even now so matt I think I am . . . Trialled and lammed   Voices in a halo to another band occupant Concinnous rhythm now a whine discrepant  In précis of my tears for desolation shards A DJ, as she, a model; beautiful queued pants Residual dale carnage posts, all due dew tart.   All night soddened in face apprehensive, contrite I pleased in rumpled sheets, my only dare height My lookalike comparison of her to an old cobber Brought on the wilt, this biff, and my footle plight One she rebuked in parse and farce Cheering to her night Wading celebration days spliced Turning a new age, truly happy without spite.  I expected better for my old gal, the trodden wall The old ghost of bad blood, despised by everyone But what came mimicked beating drums of war The percussionist literally did, collecting mulct His paradiddle, the fondle, then boss sticks drop Imploring credence of my will with a touch gall.   Supposing his steel attitude, I grinned my teeth Such a forearm touch could only be by a git She is just way too special, chose jugée She had to know, not even for a flick, if.  A clear message from a colleague Hack! And it was a good beat.  I gave a dune smile like a cretin A device holding cretin pinning whid.   Back in my office, in my chair, ill the wind I thought of disbanding, bye to the coterie Maybe for better air, but for my mood’s heed?  I’ll tell my tailor I have a better flair Not the notions dressing this affair Higgle on in my ensemble of the fair Something simple, pedestrian and breadth Sex.  It'd be too plain, too bright, so I wrote this About a black band with only a stone in it The rest all out, all to their own still.   I corral one stone at the moment  And she brushes through not one street A band slacked for her free feel To your treat.   And what does Janice say?  I've got a new girl, a hottie For you.   I hope she knows you got no birthday wishes. ",

        "chapterTextContent": "Four grey ever curving stilt trolls lift my purple one-seater The lone chair in this bedroom with faux fur giving feather Kludged out so, for I won’t let my buttocks a line that’s flat.  The house is not every old stitch seam-prick clean catered As the dining-room, it’s without stick, enter a name holder Occupied by worthening sentimental junk, sorts for a cellar.  The room next, tagged parlour has no curtains, nor is better With no door handle, my bedroom is missing several louvers When it rains, it pours in my room, so the poor curtains shiver Sliding my bed over apace, the headboard holds them in a catch.  For staying guests, it’s choose a dohyo or develop a cataract As a long time guest, I have fought, too many times crabbed And I still see, with my eyesight, it is frank better in a delta.  I've slept for days in a bedroom with cockroaches shacked It was after an apartment switch, away for weeks at large Maybe it is why my page got lotta likes from Madagascar?  Round the clock I was making a mixtape, writing a program With so much to do, being away from home was very usual With most hours in my office, only home for laundry tasks At night, I would sleep on a pile of greasy jumpsuits stacked.  Coming home finally to the new apartment brought drats It was a maladaptive snag with some pest control brands Little cockroaches numbering hundreds in night’s hands.   It was hard telling where they came from by most cards But I suspected my bed frames only, out tiny, and so calm They eventually reduced in number; several times halved That was not enough, it’d left me very dazed, so I packed.   My purple chair enjoys time alone, it’s an old shod papa Its borrowed fur is my travelling buddy, acquaint with Mat And has seen three of my houses, and is now on a fourth lap Mat is endearingly new, very young, and lately got manned.  I was on the flush toilet yesterday and there was a rat  Maybe a mouse, tiny, observing, and a bustling whit rap I made it out from the parlour, came from the cellar it had  Nothing amusing, its nimble; it had to be that absconder.   Locked motionless at the parlour’s doorway, then it departs Through the passageway, past a footlocker, moving in trad In the few seconds of its appearance, it had inched closer Not in my view now, its skedaddle for the wall and sharp.  Eyes in a wincing face owned by a head in total stealth bath Towering, deigning in silence its every move from man strata Its room entry was effortless, well imitating my own prance Next to a mop, it follows the edge, unto a black bowl's back A wash-hand basin hangs over the black bowl, it’s ever under It’d be hidden behind the shower curtain now, if now further  Silence and no movements, I remain stolid, holding my cat It shows up, sliding past the shower, and the heater tank Now having completed twice, two turns perpendicular  With few tile cells to a good scare and a successful grab It freezes by my right; I size it up like an unstriped zebra.  Did faint whiffs of my poop lure it in some attract?  Did getting so close quench all rouse of a feast pang?  I was hillock with the toilet, and wasn't its mishmash Its sudden stop started mine of odd thoughts in cark Less than a jiff, it ribs in front of the bowl in a thwart.  It had to be the poop for there was no longer a hatch Months have passed since that cement stop up patch.  Having no business with the wall, a long way of a path Its visit bruised me and the natural fashion it scarpered.  It drove through the doorway quickly, hiding in a dash And this part, I am not so sure, but for a behaviour pass.  A tiny speck appeared just at the spot I had seen it last Not after my poop myself, the lure around my sphincter I walk forward from seating to the door dropping my act And my, amiss, what is here isn't dirt or grit, but a spider  The rat had a good spider keep watch? A decoy for rank!  Die for me? In total shock I squash brusquely its topper.",

The better brand, I’ve no cent to follow.   The fluff still, I won’t have to borrow Just help. I can’t wait to tomorrow.   It was bought so, crossed out to sold I leave.

        "chapterTextContent": "For how long have I had to wear a cap? Twenty-four. If that’s a year for every hour of the day A do-rag? It’s okay to say I sleep with my cap donned.   I have nothing beautiful to hide or cover No beautiful long locks like Samson So you don’t spot my strength. Not enough ferocity as Mahsa Amini So you don’t pick out my valour.   Scars and bars, a tale starting age six. I hide scars though detained within bars Bars holding grasp-stories I could never tell A beach afternoon with my sparse hair out.   Sometimes I think when I am older . . . “Older” seems like a hold on the change I await The ums in circle of my own social weight The moral of my own morale.   Starting from just us two A ball, a light fixture, a veranda I’m six, she’s three years old The ball isn’t ours, it is lost Over the fence it came like a gift.   Back from school days after I am alone and up in the air above me It hits a glass light-fixture. Below I’m blood stained frozen in shock White shirt fused in red gush of blood Soaking . . . soon I am back to.   At the tap, I wash away thoughts of my wrong. I have a picture at seven I have an oversized watch And a scar No cap.   It asks when I’ll go without a cap Give back the oversized watch to the photographer. The one who is three thinks she did it Cos I lied. “You threw the ball, told me to go pick it.” “And it came down.”   The real fall comes from who broke the thing. For us. She says I am wrong, but I believe the older knows best “I lied back then.” How best do I know with my cap on now?   I’ll be thirty soon. When I was twenty-two I spotted no hat I tried a new haircut and a friend told me “Hey I’ve never seen you try that; I like it.” What has changed?   I convince myself it’s the nutrients But it’s the mural scars from the moral bars. The holding back; to a time I dream of A time like the past I won’t remember Six could be wrong, three could be right If I don’t do something.   I did. I recorded a public video with no cap And now I know all the help I can get. To Mahsa Amini for all the help she gets.  ",

Hellfire had bellowed at him a concuss Compromised orphically, mind fraught Quickly he douts his spliff in a full stop Triggered taut.   In hackling pule bye, he left the meetup Harlem sunset, the man loved the buds It was not the first time, but this struck; That chord.   Everyone wanted to leave town abroad He discussed plans if he struck a windfall With college degree foreign, not em duds He’d warn.   We had Hellfire, and also another Rooftop Hellfire had a shrine, house made of mud Rooftop, a home; hotel dream shutdown By a despot.   Evenings saw me over there on weed puff Two spliffs, I’m buzzing with objecting buts I left headachy, thoughts on what’s install But I enjoyed.   His Rooftop visits are points of sparse blurs He introduced me to his friend, not the club In the pictures taken, his lips held a gesture As of more.   Once with lips sucked in so long, he spouts If I would care to swap jeans, “It is grunge.” “A black knee-ripped dungaree” in a surge “Your court.”   Stuttering as I sometimes do, I stop, pause No longer in memory now; by that I let up He wanted what I had on, and for my notch Something smut.   Stonewash and a naked knee from a big gut Back having it, with a better upkeep purse I’d go down on my left knee, say the words Mariam, let’s have fun.   Seeking fun is not everything; it is the call Pleasure pairs with fun and it’s on the run In the morning it’s coffee, at night it’s rum A never humdrum.   I smoked weed for years before the breakup Twenty-one when I drew the first short puff Twenty-five and I couldn’t go on, not till dust Our divorce.   But before then, pleasure took me on tour Without Mariam, pals on the blame stub To say I did, we visited a brothel slash pub To end my grunts.   First time having hashish, lain next to a boy Wishes of it being a girl, for he dealt fudge He’d done it, he transcended, saw a whore A pivotal point.   Final summer we left campus for a reunion An old mate who’d left a fresher-abandon He lost his closer friends then to expulsion He dealt drugs.   He said he left because he got really bored Few Messenger messages, we had to claw We made plans to meet, it felt not so long He decked the halls.   Joshua not long threw a fit, fit for a jock Everything has been wrong from the jump Even the car broke. Drawing my attention Continuing in bug.   We’d just concluded our finals, no touch ups Freedom. End of university. End of lectures And a wuss who’s known, laid whores, bucks? He had my wits gone.   I’m hopeless romantic with the underworld He gets up to leave, so I follow him on abut He’s the one who’d done it; I play the bong I needed to. I must.   Just out. A thing amiss I could not tell at all That my phone was missing, it had dropped Bode handed it to me in good augur launch The worker wasn’t buff.   Nothing changed in that town and I got a job An initial hotel accommodation with hotspot My office was nearby, I was on a row of luck It was a pleasant adjust.   My new town on the scale, was a good bump A conducive estate, featuring relevant shops Quiet mornings with a keen sense impetuous For the doors!   A new Apple Mac with mountains for desktop One afternoon, my FaceTime got a cool buzz It was unexpected in every way, a total prong An employer usurp.   Longer conversations later through the duct Days after, I got money and very good cause Spending more than the month’s earn sum So I raised the crump.   Most nights, we get a drop to the same spot Light another one up, because it is that just Pepsi Cola, great skunk, and live music pump Pass the buck.   Relaxed with friends and a colleague from work Ideas we never heard flowed in slow prologue Action figure said no to excitement and crutch Fuck this crawl!   He wasn’t a coward, he balled hard, a dawg He’d sex whenever around, had no remorse A field player since his first income catapult No blotch.   Oh I just couldn’t have the habit on staunch He’d leave, my colleague was taking a drop For his hotel, we for the ATM to get blunt Following our plot.   Two luxury bedrooms to my name by dawn A tart’s iPhone on the bed, how she forgot? Out of the plot, a gang bang was her employ I too felt lost.   Another time, another place, for another shot To reignite the plot, I had just received a wand Action figure had been around, counting sluts Leaving me the clot.   Man, what do we do tonight? To me like a report . . . we should hit the club. He suggests with force No, I can't tolerate the music, smoke what I want. I returned in a punch.   Let’s get a whore, stay at home, smoke rocks It’ll be a gang bang, I’ll call up Chvrch my plug We were at a bar, waiting for meals; in decision Let’s hunt!   Using a choice service we got through the worst Met up with Chvrch for a gram of the stain blob Headed back to my apartment, ready for the fluff I was soon left in a lurch.   Action figure in the bedroom treats women as gum He chews them, pops them, and loves their engulf He’s in the bedroom, I’m in the toilet, and I’m stuck He’s the one focused.   An evening in my office, ring! My phone’s blurt Thirteen seconds of his hand gripping a fat bum Straight from the soda shop, with no blip of fuss A straight boss.   Oh, I couldn’t leave, the girl brought in no joy Her long eye lashes told me off like a soy boy And when he came in, it wasn’t at all for rush Here I was, PC Plod.   He had burnt a tiny amount, alive, and in store I am fine by this. A smile on his face as a duck My headphones made love to me like a faggot If I could see the bulge?   Then he was done, and he was around for a burn Meaning also, it was time I went for my own turn A sort of gang bang? I sensed a no daring bunch I’d stalled, for a flop.   As if facing the music, I branch out summoned A nog to what is rising and push for a mugshot He’d be there as I fucked her to watch me cum That’s the stuff.   With my pellet in, I in no time get a full stun I didn’t get it, I had on rubber, a good condom But it wasn’t real, definitely a thing was wrong I was in top crumb.   I was scared, I drew out, seeing her visage fond A second scare, it was dark and I couldn’t trust Maybe I fucked her, maybe I didn’t, can’t recall It’s a blank cloche.   Pleasure chase is everything; it isn’t always yum The hedonist serves the animal and it, his word Action figure told me all about his favourite toy An app you don’t grub.   Who will be the incel in society? Him why not. They need someone, but I found you; that’s love Like an ad, walking me through his chatting hub In measure, a tailor.   I got a girl, had her once, a time for a second She loved it, it seemed, she called, I blocked A jolly session, I pondered my condom off Oh, oh, oh her buns.   I no longer own those old rip jeans anymore But I could buy one, better, get a franchisor It could be a free rip jean brand distributor To Mariam’s love.       ",

I have nothing beautiful to hide or cover No beautiful long locks like Samson So you don’t spot my strength. Not enough ferocity as Mahsa Amini So you don’t pick out my valour. Scars and bars, a tale starting age six. I hide scars though detained within bars Bars holding grasp-stories I could never tell A beach afternoon with my sparse hair out. Sometimes I think when I am older . . . “Older” seems like a hold on the change I await The ums in circle of my own social weight The moral of my own morale. Starting from just us two A ball, a light fixture, a veranda I’m six, she’s three years old The ball isn’t ours, it is lost Over the fence it came like a gift. Back from school days after I am alone and up in the air above me It hits a glass light-fixture. Below I’m blood stained frozen in shock White shirt fused in red gush of blood Soaking . . . soon I am back to. At the tap, I wash away thoughts of my wrong. I have a picture at seven I have an oversized watch And a scar No cap. It asks when I’ll go without a cap Give back the oversized watch to the photographer. The one who is three thinks she did it Cos I lied. “You threw the ball, told me to go pick it.” “And it came down.” The real fall comes from who broke the thing. For us. She says I am wrong, but I believe the older knows best “I lied back then.” How best do I know with my cap on now? I’ll be thirty soon. When I was twenty-two I spotted no hat I tried a new haircut and a friend told me “Hey I’ve never seen you try that; I like it.” What has changed? I convince myself it’s the nutrients But it’s the mural scars from the moral bars. The holding back; to a time I dream of A time like the past I won’t remember Six could be wrong, three could be right If I don’t do something. I did. I recorded a public video with no cap And now I know all the help I can get. To Mahsa Amini for all the help she gets.  ",
