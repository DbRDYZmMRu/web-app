<p>outside still, with a fulfilled open nod</p>
<p>by the house’s fence, beating the sun</p>
<p>early tick-strike for the scending sum</p>
<p>the route’s tally, with my chest, broad</p>
<p>garbed in conflicting ensemble, dross.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As if by garrulous penury squalls</p>
<p>it is as always, so one would spot</p>
<p>my legs, squashed in jeans grudge.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Anything decent affords the top</p>
<p>sweater, tee-shirt, any singlet cut</p>
<p>and nose mask for flurrying dust.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Days in with the usual podcast off</p>
<p>day before, from a different time slot</p>
<p>it wasn’t before evening till my touch</p>
<p>I well under my own priorities’ thumb.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For days I felt frazzled, as a left stump</p>
<p>it’s this way, when by these thoughts</p>
<p>the odd ignorance leading to my flaws</p>
<p>I weigh them up like old wrecking balls</p>
<p>living as I do; everyone handed trust.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The past day’s gad provided little joy</p>
<p>my walks provide solace, but not doors</p>
<p>if only I could walk out of the scourge</p>
<p>leaving here would take an intervention</p>
<p>it’d be the true story of my recognition</p>
<p>someone had my back; they did, no buts</p>
<p>they vouched for me, that’d be the word.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It’d taken one vouching for me posthumous</p>
<p>to leaving hell for achieving imperturbation</p>
<p>with no help, I’d have been a laughing stock</p>
<p>it was 2018, I everywhere but my resolutions</p>
<p>smoking crack cocaine listening to Scorpion</p>
<p>God’s plan was for me to see a drug free dawn</p>
<p>it is here it happened, I saw my own demons</p>
<p>when I finally discovered I wasn’t having fun</p>
<p>Drake’s Don’t Matter To Me hit pretentious</p>
<p>I ‘d heard the song, but it now seemed to warn</p>
<p>Michael Jackson’s voice killed my regression</p>
<p>an adult ruining his own life for what? a bludge?</p>
<p>the dictionary reads crack cocaine is addiction</p>
<p>having helped me reach for an emergency clutch</p>
<p>I pulled the brakes and crashed in a glory grunt.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But relationships could harm like a curse</p>
<p>disorientating and changing one’s life plot</p>
<p>for good and the bad, one need only much</p>
<p>after all, it’d take the like minds to conjure</p>
<p>a team void of cooperation in basketball</p>
<p>I’ve been that herdsman with no pasture</p>
<p>what’s suffered brutally is my endeavours</p>
<p>then I met someone, and new connections</p>
<p>learned the ropes for a new communication</p>
<p>with ephemeral semiosis being a key factor</p>
<p>a new world before my eyes, in vivid colours</p>
<p>this new world of public figures’ interruption</p>
<p>his love had awakened, Tyler the creator’s.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In darkness scare, alone, confused and nowhere I belong</p>
<p>for a recent robbery had struck me into new subjugation</p>
<p>I’d quit my job to get clean, but now I’d lost my laptop</p>
<p>a news article of the richest man in the world’s bop</p>
<p>brought life, house served by Elon "EDM" Musk</p>
<p>Don't doubt your vibe because it's you in repetition</p>
<p>Don't doubt your vibe because it's true in assertion</p>
<p>Because it's you, oh and win at the psychosis ballot</p>
<p>Because it's true, you heard my song? great audition</p>
<p>I ‘d two options, do as I’ve always, or crash and burn</p>
<p>I’d just discovered telepathy and just as a premonition</p>
<p>the neighbours, my family were promising an execution</p>
<p>if friends feigned long enough, then it’d be pernicious</p>
<p>a year prior to, I released my songs on my own platform</p>
<p>Bleeding heart, ‘d the word vibe, and a video animation</p>
<p>Can I pass the vibe to you? Elon did and got involved</p>
<p>but how did he know me? to intervene was too obscure</p>
<p>yes, I took it like millions of ready pills for rejuvenation</p>
<p>loosely available on the internet, my very first junction.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jessica Andrea acquainted me with a twisted ploy</p>
<p>maybe it is Charli XCX with her own expressions</p>
<p>Demi Lovato’s overdose upsetting disintegration</p>
<p>Demi’s help was as close to Drake’s, an extension</p>
<p>I immediately hated the song Solo and all its guts</p>
<p>from an album as the name of my song in production</p>
<p>both asked, what is love? it sure wasn’t her earworm</p>
<p>I hated how I danced to it alone, and her inspiration</p>
<p>I ‘d my own addiction problems so it was a boycott</p>
<p>or it could ‘ve been Dagny guiding well my intuition</p>
<p>hers is hard to dispose as not the one culmination</p>
<p>coming on my return from Dubai, a reverse retorsion</p>
<p>her Come Over video’s intro ‘d a clangoring effort</p>
<p>her double head twitches were like abrupt rum swats</p>
<p>so taken off-guard, I pondered the artist from zillions</p>
<p>who she was, and of my business in some low disgust</p>
<p>I regretted my recent relapse, and deplored the rub</p>
<p>the YouTube video suggestion felt far from my ruck</p>
<p>I also felt the sounds were strange, a tad bit paranoid</p>
<p>saying too much to me in particular, twirling in random</p>
<p>but thereafter releases, leaned to the perspicuous</p>
<p>an almost occluded slow narration of what’s to come</p>
<p>away from the putative, for the new ears of a professor</p>
<p>this professor would invite her down, he’s got protection</p>
<p>on a certain night, there was a fountain of sperm eruption</p>
<p>living in my head with Dagny, is sure the certain elicitation</p>
<p>having binged her live shows, it was the sign to withdraw</p>
<p>it wasn’t a wet dream, in a night vision, a pleasure default.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>From her home in L.A, to few miles from Lagos</p>
<p>Jess wanted to work with me, we would be buds</p>
<p>at the time I was training on being an author</p>
<p>life was happening, living in Elon’s restoration</p>
<p>I had a demo tape out, though a bit botched</p>
<p>and was writing music for my upcoming work</p>
<p>I’d grown fond of the producer, Young Taylor</p>
<p>and was writing than ever in quantifying fruition</p>
<p>but my comments of track links got cold taciturn</p>
<p>that was two songs from the old tape I dropped</p>
<p>What is love? and Bleeding heart got the snubs</p>
<p>I’d chosen an old video on his channel to shroud</p>
<p>I wanted him involved, but broke, and a shy amateur</p>
<p>so meeting Jess meant I’d won at some competition</p>
<p>for her, my first poems were written, too enthralled</p>
<p>it’s all because of the internet I'm here, I’m the boy</p>
<p>and so for years, I was a muse in her content box</p>
<p>the only lady sex out in the open is so desirous</p>
<p>we are teammates, even when I’m playing a scuzz</p>
<p>then supermodels, the Jenners, sweet Kendall</p>
<p>Kendall convinced me of the true reconciliation</p>
<p>Kylie, the Kardashians, North, I know them all</p>
<p>Paria Hilton, but not from a book on pop culture</p>
<p>before the pilot of her marriage series, Paris in Love</p>
<p>employed, and somehow enrolled into an institution</p>
<p>love had found me, saving me in the Hilton’s disrupt.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>DJ Chantel Jeffries in a Tesla looking posh</p>
<p>an Instagram story on arriving at her destination</p>
<p>Paris’s shower, they seemed to be so numerous</p>
<p>not a single Instagram story of hers did I ignore</p>
<p>CJ took me to my sister, told me I’d count bucks</p>
<p>I remember the black and white tiles in rhombus</p>
<p>but I had not a scintilla idea whose home it was</p>
<p>prior to being acquainted with Jess, just before</p>
<p>Charli XCX  had zoomed Paris for her album</p>
<p>I picked up sliving, it was How I’m feeling Now</p>
<p>I discovered her in 2019, on the one eponymous</p>
<p>in Dubai, on a trip that should ‘ve been a vacation</p>
<p>the trip ended with me needing resuscitation</p>
<p>achieved when I saw her cameltoe in transition</p>
<p>the cart tart’s leg spread was a pleasant shock</p>
<p>I’d refused meals, so she served the gorgeous</p>
<p>and 2020 came, year of Covid-19 and dark humour</p>
<p>it marked my meeting Paris Hilton in the memorious</p>
<p>she is who to know, as Paris held on to her pup</p>
<p>she’s got so many pets, maybe it’s Diamond</p>
<p>it marked in recency as my first introduction</p>
<p>I always knew her, a feeling from old songs</p>
<p>I remember her teasing meme, son, son, son</p>
<p>of Richard and Kathy Hilton’s adoption</p>
<p>parties before the wedding, the bachelor</p>
<p>Carter Reum, the pleasant yells, and calls</p>
<p>Barron, Nicky, Conrad in a wedding picture</p>
<p>dad sending chills in skin glow that’s envious</p>
<p>one also giving an old memory of mine, vision</p>
<p>as if to ease out with my natural dad’s friction</p>
<p>for one morning, as if just done with lubrication</p>
<p>he was in our apartment in severe grease odour</p>
<p>my natural parents have a lasting sung discord</p>
<p>so she moved into the other room on my relocation</p>
<p>he’d come for her, I’m not sure what he’d to inform</p>
<p>I was suffering a relapse and thought of the worst</p>
<p>he was a mechanic just arriving from his workshop?</p>
<p>for he’d slept out and a retired officer in customs.</p>

<p>It is one of the times he has teased my depressions</p>
<p>there is a favourite, it helped my relapse intention</p>
<p>it’s a picture of him in a blue cardigan with nap fuzz</p>
<p>a black pant, belt in place, waist strap in a slump</p>
<p>it reminded me of the old sad days of distortion</p>
<p>an event from 2018 back when I was handcuffed</p>
<p>fed up, I had discussed about my resignation</p>
<p>I’d to get clean from weed use, and a new drug</p>
<p>crack-cocaine had thrown me into compulsion</p>
<p>the wrong crowd ‘d led to my call for termination</p>
<p>I’d a drug problem, and knew I needed a solution</p>
<p>few weeks later in my studio apartment, still hurt</p>
<p>in rue, I took weary pictures with joints in the mug</p>
<p>I was by the window, topless, with eyes bloodshot</p>
<p>and like my dad, I’d on a slim belt, but colour brown</p>
<p>a friend had taken back a belt gift, as if to deplore</p>
<p>on knowledge of solemnity; my new leaf resolution</p>
<p>he Jinx was ruthless on a new air of demeanour</p>
<p>an inexpensive belt, it’d take more to get drunk</p>
<p>in oversized jeans, the picture still is an eyesore</p>
<p>but my dad has helped me forge ahead, beyond</p>
<p>there wasn’t hope, only desertion in the capture.</p>

<p>For me it was the worst picture in the world</p>
<p>so I tucked it in the cloud off the Samsung</p>
<p>I remember years later receiving a notification</p>
<p>now drug free, having very raw mixed emotions</p>
<p>I had been away from the device for too long</p>
<p>the memories hit me to a new lonely position</p>
<p>for dad was new, but ’d made me house shop</p>
<p>all in my names, there’d be no date of return.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Come seventeen months later, I am floored</p>
<p>by a princess few months from being an adult</p>
<p>Leonor, Princess of Asturias hit my apricot </p>
<p>her sis, Infanta Sofia of Spain is the bomb</p>
<p>one day I could become king of their kingdom</p>
<p>as if in a fairy tale, everything would blossom</p>
<p>I’ll need to make it to Spain first past her chum</p>
<p>but I’ve opted for being just friends in suture</p>
<p>for the meantime, mum wanted this book done</p>
<p>after spending a year plus in deep hibernation</p>
<p>what you read now is its journey to completion</p>
<p>it’s when I’d be allowed to move into my own turf</p>
<p>uptown real estate, the gifts my parents bought</p>
<p>a new business address, an office with elevator</p>
<p>and my residence, a penthouse, it’s my mansion</p>
<p>so mum’s got me connected in relevant sectors</p>
<p>and dad has my word to be in Europe on tour</p>
<p>maybe with both princesses I’ll get some jaunts</p>
<p>after my business commitments, we could jaywalk</p>
<p>I’d be well into my textbooks then and studious</p>
<p>just as I’ve committed to dad, focused and bluff</p>
<p>my English should help my Spanish transport.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>So I believe in relationship accord</p>
<p>having only recently been foxed</p>
<p>my bottled thoughts sought shore</p>
<p>in tow was an umbrage floe to thaw</p>
<p>as criminals are not in extinction</p>
<p>who is a stranger? I mulled</p>
<p>anyone who’d change in a spurt</p>
<p>a colleague who’d pull fraud?</p>
<p>then I never knew them for sure</p>
<p>how can I tell the tactics to employ?</p>
<p>from my shortcomings, my dereliction</p>
<p>it’s the pet peeve, maim to my purse</p>
<p>it would have served me for months</p>
<p>but I was gullible and lost composure</p>
<p>in hindsight, it’s quite incredulous</p>
<p>how the couple fed my perceptions</p>
<p>subtle lies that roused my conviction</p>
<p>a pregnancy claim lost on inspection</p>
<p>convincing of recency, hence no bump</p>
<p>it’s few weeks old,  and it was enough</p>
<p>we met working for an organisation</p>
<p>the branch was of goods distribution</p>
<p>he was the more skilled at the labour</p>
<p>and I got fired due to his misconduct</p>
<p>it’s been the irony of my compunction</p>
<p>for he held back my wages and dodged</p>
<p>and brought up atrocious suggestions</p>
<p>as pushing for loan, a clear insurrection</p>
<p>with the manager upset in consternation</p>
<p>he ‘d us exit before the day’s resumption</p>
<p>the morning broke in brusque dismissions</p>
<p>he provided fare and news of expulsion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I left with everything I had brought</p>
<p>and we maintained a good rapport</p>
<p>we previously worked in manufacture</p>
<p>then left the hood for the troughs</p>
<p>but of different times, our report</p>
<p>the outlet job was the real comfort</p>
<p>so we all returned in the same bus</p>
<p>he’d a place close they could squat</p>
<p>my secondary school was few blocks</p>
<p>a job agent, she’d been his previous</p>
<p>his friend lived some scores seconds</p>
<p>from my house, he seemed ever around</p>
<p>so it was natural, to my consideration</p>
<p>I’d some old items to sell at low costs</p>
<p>two 4G mobile routers with no faults</p>
<p>they both were in perfect conditions</p>
<p>I’d use the pay for data subscriptions</p>
<p>it would stifle fears of disconnection</p>
<p>I had work with Diplo, some chores</p>
<p>as well as a new demo tape’s revision.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He offered a hand in elation</p>
<p>as he’d earn on its conclusion</p>
<p>he’d need a phone to support</p>
<p>to call people who could procure</p>
<p>asking for mine for my demotion</p>
<p>springing up an idea in a new form</p>
<p>a phone to raise the sum’s account</p>
<p>so he left with another for the buzz</p>
<p>that’s two modems and phones lost</p>
<p>he got bullied, beating, and robbed</p>
<p>wife by side, and my items to oblivion</p>
<p>he walked into his story’s direction.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With the dark canopy, I felt a throb</p>
<p>from my mistakes and bad intuition</p>
<p>he bore no pains, cuts or body sores</p>
<p>only a sharp news, and very abrupt</p>
<p>he’d travelled further for the meet up</p>
<p>with reasons to be conscientious</p>
<p>but unfortunately, he was met by goons</p>
<p>his wife plaited his hair as I implored</p>
<p>as other lovers warmed into discussions</p>
<p>the night canopy got some illumination</p>
<p>as if suddenly translucent from inversion</p>
<p>I knew I had to leave, I had lost course</p>
<p>his last lines were the worst of any actor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It’s behind, my mind settling dust</p>
<p>I'm not the only one with a loss</p>
<p>I thought on, in calming brush </p>
<p>ambling in originally scruffy crocs</p>
<p>I’d slipped in them with no remorse</p>
<p>I was optimistic about my narration</p>
<p>being myopic, he fulfilled his rush</p>
<p>leaving me stranded and misinformed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Just when I bemoaned taut</p>
<p>the cars parked in the lot</p>
<p>awed by their odd file sort</p>
<p>so much room, it is Thurs!</p>
<p>I get a ticker-smack in sight of a neighbour </p>
<p>in closer toggery to mine; mine, a total wall</p>
<p>what I’d parade in, if I could hit the store</p>
<p>green striped vest, black banded shorts</p>
<p>it transfixed me unto a shame soapbox.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’d never seen him on a morning run</p>
<p>or walk, any luxury afforded in stall</p>
<p>since living and working from my sump</p>
<p>my current room, year count on four</p>
<p>I’m still here, but pretentiously poor</p>
<p>I am without an access to any funds</p>
<p>access would mean a final full stop</p>
<p>Bury me in 1965 poetry outpour.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That wasn’t always the padlock</p>
<p>finishing this book for a windfall</p>
<p>cleaning my act up for the new job</p>
<p>I had challenges of my impression</p>
<p>it left me a student in a sable pod</p>
<p>metricizing the right and the wrong</p>
<p>in the face of my career and focus.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Perspiring bitty from his pores</p>
<p>well spiffy, and skin dewy flush</p>
<p>with none of his sobriquet fawn</p>
<p>or accustomed air, puppy talk</p>
<p>nor his gung-ho, compère fog</p>
<p>he reminds in a ghost spawned</p>
<p>of the wipe in an intone sprawl</p>
<p>then after a long pause . . .</p>
<p>with his face put off</p>
<p>he looks away in a face shove</p>
<p>seeping the damp from my cloths</p>
<p>continuing his way, fumbling tall</p>
<p>for the pedestrial lot gate in strut.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In my head, on my skin, I felt an old smut</p>
<p>the wipe, the intentional wipe, in murmur</p>
<p>not at first!</p>
<p>I quipped back, seeking another retort</p>
<p>now by my house’s entrance, in reflection</p>
<p>I go in pushing the gate very impassioned.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’d it for some months, and free from maul</p>
<p>with growing spite from my biological mum</p>
<p>I'll talk later on this, belch on a bit more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With poetry to type for a manuscript shot</p>
<p>I’d just concluded the first Frith collection</p>
<p>short of a battery pack, a reliable keyboard</p>
<p>a working operating system safe from cruft</p>
<p>a screen not responsible for all of the blush</p>
<p>I went for it regardless of any other pitfalls</p>
<p>eyes peeled on the power cord and fraught</p>
<p>I was lucky to have it, I’d felt long, very stuck.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was not really a wipe, if bringing in fuss</p>
<p>as it came from an accidental reset prompt</p>
<p>one I jolted at, as if without comprehension</p>
<p>two reset prompts, and the latter with funk</p>
<p>when I really did run the genuine file dump</p>
<p>the second time, intentional, by my mores</p>
<p>it was hard saying sorry, being good sport.</p>`, 

`<p>Pipes are a must go</p>
<p>none should be left alone</p>
<p>no place this doesn't hold</p>
<p>at the factory in tow</p>
<p>outlets where they are sold</p>
<p>it’s the gnome.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>First workday, a Monday for the bone</p>
<p>I arrive an early riser, with the sun’s glow</p>
<p>you are late, he had invoked</p>
<p>be here before six o'clock, on he poked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I had on, not too shabby clothes</p>
<p>I really was casually robed</p>
<p>like our first encounter, he sat reposed</p>
<p>this is the day I had taken a new road.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Vale. I sought a better mood comb</p>
<p>a more interesting stroll back home</p>
<p>these walks have helped me to cope</p>
<p>I tell myself that a lot, if on the nose</p>
<p>that much time in a room, corners so close</p>
<p>walking every morning held back my groans</p>
<p>I baulked at anguish and the gnarly crows.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He’d told me, though there’d be no brogues</p>
<p>he saw only two days before the end of show</p>
<p>no paperwork, and yes, he is the CSO.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It'd be a curve to see, if I could cope</p>
<p>come the third day of attendance roll</p>
<p>I'd be working for twelve hours or so</p>
<p>he’d responded almost in antic rote</p>
<p>where have you worked?  he posed</p>
<p>asking on my inquiry, in obvious moat.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It came to you a paraphrase, no quotes</p>
<p>his English, broken when he spoke</p>
<p>but all he did was write, who knows . . .</p>
<p>auditing names . . . playing who's the foe?</p>
<p>he met with the manager often, guess it followed . . .</p>
<p>I saw him a couple times by my post.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He taunted about ties in bows</p>
<p>I guess white-collar jobs need those</p>
<p>I’d never worn one to match my sole</p>
<p>or he regarded my not making payroll?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The wages for the day's role . . .</p>
<p>you can start tomorrow</p>
<p>phones aren't allowed . . . oh!</p>
<p>true . . . he’d caught a colleague's broach</p>
<p>it's Sunday tomorrow, Monday we coach</p>
<p>just signing in, working the grill entrance’s bolt</p>
<p>the CSO informs him of the staff’s growth</p>
<p>looking at me, turning in a limp, hands thrown</p>
<p>not saying much, affirming what I’d been told</p>
<p>he gestures, and wades in like the shift's crone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That weekend, he wasn't the only weirdo</p>
<p>minutes ago, I ‘d walked past a cyclops cold</p>
<p>exiting late, he'd just checked out of his own</p>
<p>surely he had worked during the night zone</p>
<p>relating with the crowd as of the same boat.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It's different now, like an old coat</p>
<p>stay with me, it is the fold</p>
<p>this crowd still keeps its old ode</p>
<p>only I, a new understanding, a new dado.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Getting a job that morning was the goal</p>
<p>job in quotes, emphasis borrowed;</p>
<p>from a silent whisper in my head now rogue</p>
<p>I did to mollify my laziness getting stoked.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Putting it that way for an acute stroke</p>
<p>for the shade of the putative mono.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was drudgery, no skills required, done pronto</p>
<p>believe it or not, I was ready to roll the stone</p>
<p>my natural parents are believers, chiming bingo!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I needed the job to buy a new mobile phone</p>
<p>the last one had been seized, the poor gizmo</p>
<p>he even contributed some text, that old ghost.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thirty days is a deal, and I could be prone</p>
<p>who knows, I could bow out from the ropes</p>
<p>I’d do it for the books, but maybe I’d choke</p>
<p>but boy I was down; I was here for the load.</p>`, 

`<p>Retiring for my bed weak</p>
<p>eyes bleary, and bored stiff</p>
<p>arms and legs odd-dots burdened</p>
<p>sprung like victimised prude toothpicks</p>
<p>laying prone, numb in toned fatigue.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the shadow waiting . . .</p>
<p>as further from pleasing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I flip supine, imitating a body sweep</p>
<p>scanning with my thoughts, feeling</p>
<p>in a meditative crawl, expecting . . .</p>
<p>the attention in itself soothing</p>
<p>knowing there will be no yanking</p>
<p>. . . slow to drowsy</p>
<p>I awaited sleep.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The first night's ease</p>
<p>came rushing in</p>
<p>slumberous memories . . .</p>
<p>it was quick</p>
<p>falling asleep</p>
<p>the day before, Monday was a treat.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But tonight's of a different bit</p>
<p>I’d come home to some gifts</p>
<p>memories of my old phone’s screen</p>
<p>the flashes had seemed more compelling.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I was stuck, fuming in a kiln</p>
<p>held back past the alarm ring</p>
<p>and it would be bad for me</p>
<p>for next day’s work, and what I’d seek</p>
<p>which is different now by the fee</p>
<p>thirty days for heavy mobile data swig</p>
<p>with the old phone back, I’d get a SIM.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Having had a shy at yesterday's evening</p>
<p>briskly done with laundry</p>
<p>with ten hours for the win</p>
<p>enough time in the quilt</p>
<p>I had dinner in between</p>
<p>and settled in bed clean</p>
<p>I'd like to think</p>
<p>almost suffering a mood swing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Away with the toes on my feet</p>
<p>my big toes' nails sidelong green</p>
<p>green like my room’s curtain linings</p>
<p>from the powder swept that morning</p>
<p>I’d washed really hard, with no electricity</p>
<p>with faint odours on my hand still remaining</p>
<p>from the smeared gloves, of residual grease;</p>
<p>I wasn't given one, I got mine from a clean filch</p>
<p>not from anyone, an adeptly guileless pick</p>
<p>from the only desk I know he sits at to eat</p>
<p>this really is the only desk from my post’s view</p>
<p>a post as inconsequential and as dismissive.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It’s a desk another sits and also well fits</p>
<p>doing so whenever he does his log filling</p>
<p>similar to the CSO’s, probably a twin</p>
<p>obviously trained personnel in the team</p>
<p>but not a detail in the team on security.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I never did get to speak with him</p>
<p>to this writer in my desk’s dream</p>
<p>for by the pipe line I was ever busy. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>But you could find this man there eating</p>
<p>has he any business there, when he’s seen?</p>
<p>not any time in the proper, I think this being</p>
<p>hold the status quo supervisor of the factory</p>
<p>I only spoke to him over  a couple of beefs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Oh, maybe the table isn't his?</p>
<p>it’s obvious than a cunning scheme</p>
<p>such disrespect to do that, isn't it?</p>
<p>or it is my previous collar and its bling?</p>
<p>he could be co-ordinator of everything</p>
<p>I don’t like him, neither his several whims</p>
<p>that lone desk was the crème de la crème</p>
<p>none wrote by it, just a guy on internship</p>
<p>I saw him once, the same day I said, I quit</p>
<p>he also wrote by the pipes in tow briefly</p>
<p>there were others writing too, definitely</p>
<p>they towered over us in their high offices.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He had assistant precede his initialism</p>
<p>bleh, I never got to doing any liking</p>
<p>or his initialism either, any remembering</p>
<p>he was gone and he behaved differently.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In some corners, you’ll hear it's a big erring</p>
<p>this initialism tailing his slim harangue steam</p>
<p>all silently whispered against his apodeictic</p>
<p>he worked for buck and didn’t care the least</p>
<p>and well imposed on our job’s security peace.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Who then really is this man in bearing?</p>
<p>he comes and goes, but never in a hurry</p>
<p>and for one isn't in the least, god-fearing</p>
<p>like the visitor from the chokehold authorities </p>
<p>the government's big boss who came inspecting.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Big boss's perfume had a certain ilk</p>
<p>the pungency of a devotee’s fetish </p>
<p>maybe it isn't, could be my attributing</p>
<p>but I recognize the smell as a bait’s grip</p>
<p>an item in my natural parents’ retreat in panics</p>
<p>following their nine-one-one call response heed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Well at first, I was in good cheer by the greetings</p>
<p>Monday morning saw him with an orientation checklist</p>
<p>we’d the employment, the company’s recruited new three</p>
<p>informing on their affairs, dos, don’ts, air, will and the grim</p>
<p>he went on about us working to the top, and the wind chill</p>
<p>I was starting helper, he declared, later stirring some tiff.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That morning, I was in a whole different league</p>
<p>I could not reconcile all of the messy cleaning</p>
<p>I was chunking out waste, gathering the musty</p>
<p>with a spooky broom, its bristles ineffective</p>
<p>it is still very rattling, as well as disturbing</p>
<p>he mentioned starting as so to suggest a win</p>
<p> </p>
<p>How has that been, his bid?</p>
<p>his back still into it; working? </p>
<p>he does do some work it seems</p>
<p>enjoying the chill as he breathes</p>
<p>his chores include type branding</p>
<p>after a good lunch, he’s seen loafing</p>
<p>you’ll find him by pipes, stamping</p>
<p>pretending to check for quality</p>
<p>dismissing the well-known phony</p>
<p>unmistakable funny-voiced wimp</p>
<p>whom to his conscientious notoriety</p>
<p>watering his sympatric ick wishy-washy</p>
<p>sees to the quality assurance artifice</p>
<p>swinging by moments after he leaves.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It could be both of their clingings</p>
<p>two men on an unnecessary duty</p>
<p>quality assured with a slung grin.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As to whom this helper was helping?</p>
<p>he wanted me, I was the credible shim</p>
<p>I loved him for his boots as brute steel</p>
<p>his tribal tongue’s effect on English</p>
<p>I usually would walk past in teeming zeal</p>
<p>expect a crotch raise puff a cranky chink.</p>
<p>he had that certain air to him, he's neat</p>
<p>kept his own water bottle; clue to his wit</p>
<p>so day two I had a bottle for myself filled</p>
<p>but was told off by a colleague of disease.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That night, briefly unable to sleep, in drift</p>
<p>I cleared, something is in the water, think</p>
<p>for my wakefulness, I couldn’t tell which</p>
<p>the water, or the screen set to my face lit</p>
<p>I was back to my mobile, resolved to my grit</p>
<p>my acuity was fine, but I’d lost my action’s beat</p>
<p>the three hand-me-downs, and cell lured meaning</p>
<p>all four on my bed, the vileness had me crestfallen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>He’d helped me with the dust clearing</p>
<p>briefly showing me tacitly by doing</p>
<p>the first morning saw me close to my kneels</p>
<p>as the instructions swayed in quiet brandishing</p>
<p>I was very gullible, and a pushover on resuming</p>
<p>I barely spoke to anyone, not simple questioning</p>
<p>there were female cleaners, those crocky cheats</p>
<p>whom I saw, despising, on the second day finally</p>
<p>with backs bent, facing waste water, scooping</p>
<p>everyone there had me play cleaner in cecity</p>
<p>maybe it gave them a bang, some ol' good trip. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>He is the engineer gone crazy</p>
<p>so went everyone bandying</p>
<p>he is cute but I think very clumsy</p>
<p>I am too, when plugged in, with an earpiece</p>
<p>and there is a pretty girl, a sweet tootsie.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We barely on my first day got the deal</p>
<p>producing no pipes till the evening's seal</p>
<p>the last hour was of heaping and banding</p>
<p>with my afternoon spent heavy lifting </p>
<p>and as collateral and unproductive</p>
<p>they mostly were rejects, scrap things</p>
<p>that muscle-toned body? I wasn’t convinced</p>
<p>he wasn't a new recruit, I was, and candid</p>
<p>didn't see myself ever being of blue-chip</p>
<p>or moving up this ladder of no paperclips</p>
<p>the control area, its wires, patches, end slits</p>
<p>the quagmires, his perceived wins, and spins</p>
<p>had me so overwhelmed, could it all be fiddling?</p>
<p>then I saw the inducting manual on the machine</p>
<p>and in that moment, hope was restored, ching!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dressed in an attire that's native</p>
<p>the ubiquitous patterned print</p>
<p>he doesn't hide in his sleeve</p>
<p>his obvious tribal favouritism</p>
<p>chroming his brother's lid</p>
<p>forgetting the obvious lackey</p>
<p>none other than yours truly</p>
<p>it just was sad, a fair admitting</p>
<p>I’d say no quibbles, no taunting</p>
<p>no glibness from my end or gibs </p>
<p>pun intended, no crippling stilt</p>
<p>he wished he was the rich chief.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yes I left the village too, who is this?</p>
<p>here is the countenance of his discipline</p>
<p>how many chiefs to get that instilled?</p>
<p>he had the boorish unlikely skin</p>
<p>his shaved hair showed his maudlin</p>
<p>I am corralling glibness? well probably</p>
<p>I didn't like him, it is my fervent scream</p>
<p>he held no power, speaking searingly. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I had gotten my phone, I'll save the story</p>
<p>I came home to it, the tale bears nothing</p>
<p>someone is hoping I’m still that little kid</p>
<p>storks visit parents with new-born babies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On the third day, things went implosive</p>
<p>engineer gone crazy was with a weenie</p>
<p>they spoke casually, posturing too silly</p>
<p>by the generators, they stood chattery</p>
<p>both engineers I bet have no degrees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Doing the usual—lifting and heaving</p>
<p>since we weren’t doing any producing</p>
<p>I got sent around a lot in close tugging</p>
<p>I helped unload a truck with the codgerly</p>
<p>he told me of his woes; how the job stinks</p>
<p>and I wondered, arms puffed, how he grew</p>
<p>too old now to complain of fortune or will?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So I quit on the third day after a meal</p>
<p>I had gotten some sou fiat sheets</p>
<p>surprised at how relatively expensive</p>
<p>how I couldn't buy noodles for a tit</p>
<p>I had some peanuts and biscuits</p>
<p>and came home with the change gleaming</p>
<p>because I had struck on a new opportunity</p>
<p>but it didn’t appear out of the air thin.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I was telling Mr initialism I quit and betraying</p>
<p>his favourite's heads up were: not suddenly</p>
<p>wait till the end of the day, I’ll add a good tip</p>
<p>he promised to help me with my pay receiving</p>
<p>while he helped me at my job for no reason</p>
<p>he was actually doing his job; I was there merely</p>
<p>not just him, another dude on bammy sleeping pill</p>
<p>couldn’t tell what, but the favourite poured a drink</p>
<p>out of a sachet, no label, the pellucid kind, I quill. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wait till the end of the day, he hissed</p>
<p>that was morning, it was lunch, my toodle pip</p>
<p>impromptu, I showed up with a filled belly</p>
<p>and guess who I was meeting?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr initialism told me I could leave, please</p>
<p>if only for once I could save my euphemisms</p>
<p>no remorse, I wasn't a model, I had ditched</p>
<p>whom the favourite had in mind when he promised?</p>
<p>I couldn’t tell, it isn't clear, besides he was hinged. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Bye, we are not paying</p>
<p>I was told by the CSO it goes daily</p>
<p>remember, no paper works, sweet loopholing</p>
<p>it was good sinking dialogue in my mind's sink. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>the manager had said they’d be doing accounting</p>
<p>not that week though, it’d be the upcoming week</p>
<p>we’d create bank accounts to be added to the list</p>
<p>information changes, it’s about who you’re asking.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The favourite had traits of my natural dad, feels</p>
<p>I didn't tell him, but it could have been a tale hill</p>
<p>trust me, I wish I had more time for the peeping</p>
<p>all of my findings would have left me quite happy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In retrospect, for reporting</p>
<p>it was nothing but a round of the classic</p>
<p>he was a new arrival who’d found his party</p>
<p>and he at once got to do it already</p>
<p>sleeping in the compound, no one sees</p>
<p>it all just bores me, this drawing</p>
<p>reporting to anyone his inept skills.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr initialism, I prefer chintz</p>
<p>I don't quite remember you charming. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>All through I posed with my limbs</p>
<p>throwing off a ready for work shrill</p>
<p>maybe it was too loud—too overkill.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The third guy, lending</p>
<p>like a side chick</p>
<p>same tribe as me, a we?</p>
<p>if he could just be my Jill</p>
<p>he’d be my favourite</p>
<p>we would end guy two in a twig.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Considerably . . .</p>
<p>same age, but he spoke with an ill</p>
<p>if, and few times I thought him speaking. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Like a frail well done, in all that blaring</p>
<p>moving on, showing no wrenching</p>
<p>well balanced, hand clenching . . .</p>
<p>the biggest pipe in casting</p>
<p>a pipe I never got to lift</p>
<p>the pipe’s size was mayhem's shadow pit</p>
<p>come meet the glorious beast</p>
<p>the prize for all your toiling.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>disturbing was that the thought of the feat</p>
<p>until my introduction at the outlet-reach</p>
<p>it wasn't bad, get a balance, grip it between</p>
<p>openly at the factory, I played body building</p>
<p>throw it at me, I am in custodianship.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Days later at the outlet, for a colleague </p>
<p>I well could have been seen as a chicken</p>
<p>counting the days he played supreme</p>
<p>by keeping the skill of need</p>
<p>it was barely a one minute teach.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now tell me about the real</p>
<p>the wonders of improvising. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a close the favourite can't write or bleat.</p>`, 
`<p>Aches, grades</p>
<p>oh, my rib cage</p>
<p>four rootings of the gradational pale</p>
<p>first session, a two point eight C.G.P.A</p>
<p>two quiet nights, and a jostle roused wake</p>
<p>from break in propriety at the backstage</p>
<p>with the spotlight on an address case:</p>
<p>university life and its juvenility sacrilege</p>
<p>the evincible fresher, a final adulterate</p>
<p>at indifference at assessment takes</p>
<p>my walk through the academic glade</p>
<p>moments to recall in ruminative passage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the topical ever goes old school, this also will fade</p>
<p>a student whose ways, even in tale, way, all too sways</p>
<p>for the English lecturer had a thing for his marriage</p>
<p>and in class wanted his tuck neat, and cast captain</p>
<p>first year, the year of waggon barter, start bargain</p>
<p>he’d a skin colour of that dipped in clear chocolate </p>
<p>and melts the labour of the dip: come and partake.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rumours fared of her wanting him in saturnine haste</p>
<p>end of class, all to herself, by her desk, to hold his waist</p>
<p>a thing for this married constable and this espy craze</p>
<p>a dispelling with the charge: show me the early sage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Those early days, there was a physicist with the gauge</p>
<p>her cans flustered everyone, not vying for right acclaim</p>
<p>a new day came, of our cherished gone and of her fame</p>
<p>just two regular knockers shrivelled from a wide mileage</p>
<p>he said to me, I fucked her couple times during the holiday</p>
<p>she who’d call me late nights, he’d beat me to cannulate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Notoriously ever polar clad in ostentatious haze</p>
<p>he made no turn to speak, as if thought chaste</p>
<p>and usually snickered quickly to hood his jade</p>
<p>talking friends? it wasn’t tangible beyond surface</p>
<p>my relationships were like brief exciting matinées</p>
<p>I was popular, like a frequent itinerant to an arcade</p>
<p>our pictures together remind me of chored praise</p>
<p>orchestrated at my ol' . . . forget it, his pep pied shades</p>
<p>a thing for companies, his humouring garb masquerade.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All opined on my sartorial certitude, its altitude’s delineate</p>
<p>the staple of the first week, my sunglasses that Sunday</p>
<p>in time, all these I realised isn’t the crux, and I soon changed</p>
<p>it was my second university, and it hadn’t been a social gate</p>
<p>being stiffy here wasn’t guaranteeing me any lasting efface</p>
<p>to become anew, an undergraduate who’d face his baggage</p>
<p>I needed something tangible, the worthwhile I’d embrace</p>
<p>not just embrace, but I could go on to master and baste</p>
<p>I opted for arranging 808s, drums, piano rolls, and bass</p>
<p>I began with his PC and made a couple known folks gape</p>
<p>he was quite amiable, and returned to the halls very late</p>
<p>he thought for moments at once; took for music, a break</p>
<p>amongst his true love to the end in a sunset chase rage</p>
<p>made his points clear and was sure to sundry, a ready bake</p>
<p>contemporary gospel, and a winning cantor’s badge drape</p>
<p>the town was his, where the denomination, his dutch's age</p>
<p>his girl, whom he’d pledged his troth, she visited everyday</p>
<p>well, it seemed it, seeing her complexion; his bromidic stay</p>
<p>contrasting his in a day, night, quiet, loud opposing page</p>
<p>lending to say, he’d his sunshine around way up the scale</p>
<p>at the same place, where he is known to round, the café</p>
<p>just as his roomie, one pimple-speckled-dense estranged.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pimple bought no meals, word was he was saving for a make</p>
<p>the bad boy toy Ferrari, as most of the crowd had weighed </p>
<p>but he was saving to be a neophyte, one of porn industry’s slaves</p>
<p>final year, he stately made known, I’d no interest or erotic craves</p>
<p>but it’s a very long time from now, and so if he still well mansplains</p>
<p>maybe he could convince my wife, Corinna Kopf to participate</p>
<p>and hers, Stella Barey too, in a threesome picture for his main</p>
<p>lady Mikayla Demaiter could be the one leaving the set ashamed</p>
<p>the cinematographer who broke into the scene, for all to ruminate</p>
<p>rue, the consequences of seeing any blue film with any underage</p>
<p>for it could be the same, losing their minds, so very inconsiderate</p>
<p>but he’d also need to consider how well our humanity appertains</p>
<p>promise us a set with just cameras, no treacle, it’d be of the quaint</p>
<p>it’d be old love making with respect, one of our desires to exfoliate</p>
<p>reminding me so well of Kendall Jenner and desires that incriminate</p>
<p>she'd me replace Corinna on the cover of my Screen time mixtape</p>
<p>Kendall and I had bone, but with my choice Corinna, it was cartilage </p>
<p>she then asked I humour her with a nude cover with her phone's face</p>
<p>so well into the mixtape, and in love, I offered her my Hilton surname</p>
<p>but it wasn't straightforward, no, it started from emotional scrimmage.</p>

<p>Chantel introduced me to Alissa Violet, and her sister Seemaje</p>
<p>Selah Jeffries her sis, has convinced me of the kitchen’s blockade</p>
<p>I’m convinced baking croissants is for chefs and is to be deliberate</p>
<p>it’s one of the reasons Shayna Terese Taylor and I are engaged</p>
<p>she told me my dad bought her a farm house, a place to disassociate</p>
<p>an escape destination when I’ve got writer’s block or need to sashay</p>
<p>Alissa and I are both Christians, so we share an idea to procreate</p>
<p>she’s sexy too, most Christians are, this is one’s hope to sanitate.</p>

<p>When I met Jess, my mind could only conceive of a lady’s birthday</p>
<p>no! polyamory is illegal, outdated, anti-society, talk from the sewage</p>
<p>all these ‘s changed with romantic interest in more ladies than AIDS</p>
<p>as CJ with a post caption: 2 is better than 1, two sisters on pay?</p>
<p>and through her, Carmella Rose, Mariam Rod, Kate Beckinsale</p>
<p>Janice Joostema, Meredith Mickelson, Ice Spice, Alice Palay</p>
<p>Maya Henry, Mahlagha Jaberi, and my hype DJ, Sommer Ray.</p>

<p>Serendipity, a movie Jess suggested, it’s where I first saw Kate</p>
<p>then I followed Guilty Party series and thought it quite accurate</p>
<p>with how sexy I’d seen an older woman’s face and body nominate</p>
<p>she helped pique my recording interest with a charge to generate</p>
<p>not wanting the streets of Europe forgetting my voice or tapes</p>
<p>for her advice, I’m still here today, I could refer to it as the big lace</p>
<p>the early days when she’d make me laugh like soaking in marinade</p>
<p>there were months of no recording but I’d suffused the landscape</p>
<p>I did hit on her one broody time, but her response hinted to deface</p>
<p>amidst mixed signals, fears of being too new to want any scrimmage</p>
<p>I eased up, like I did with Lewis Hamilton and all seeming too innate</p>
<p>from my poetry first collection, patterns looking like one I’d fabricate</p>
<p>settling on Blacktop Garage at page forty-four as one to inebriate</p>
<p>as random as the big bang, or as propensity with attention regained.</p>

<p>No. forty-four ‘s me, but Kendall Jenner has me a roiled jackanapes</p>
<p>our fizzy romance of late is frightening, and I’m stuck in her carriage</p>
<p>my love’s doubled, and is well in the end for her to take this suffrage</p>
<p>when everything here is done, for her to come down to see me, I’ll give cake</p>
<p>for I’ve ‘d a thing for her years now, and it’s been a fair amity-scape</p>
<p>I only truly wonder if it is her fancy, over here visiting the consulate</p>
<p>getting married, have kids, sort of things that’ll see us never separate.</p>

<p>Time, a pundit of change has left me with those words to impregnate</p>
<p>as Corinna, Stella, and Mikayla giving up indecency in a final micturate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Third year, year of weed, filled with memories eternally impaled</p>
<p>I was adventurous and hung around anyone who wouldn’t flay</p>
<p>I criticized all who used until then, and lo, I too was raising Cain</p>
<p>I was with Pimple, and we headed out past nine p.m. out my grain</p>
<p>to everyone, I was in school, for I’d left earlier for the known gaol</p>
<p>on arrival, we both went thrifting, and it went well with no complaint</p>
<p>on returning, my new girlfriend welcomed me in slush rush fellate</p>
<p>he’d hooked us up, a young porn star from the brightest furnace</p>
<p>I’d gotten her ID days before, she was digging my cyber-image</p>
<p>we loved a band, so she rammed their names at me, time and again</p>
<p>I enjoyed One Direction’s music, so it helped me to consolidate</p>
<p>when his girl arrived, we headed out with his dad’s car in carnage</p>
<p>the venue bustled, but he convinced clubbing ends the mundane</p>
<p>by midnight we could go in, then we would enjoy the sound buffet</p>
<p>he’d left for the barbecue, leaving his girl, who’s somewhat soignée</p>
<p>I looked like I owned the hotel, only young, relaxed, and behaved</p>
<p>with beanie, black tee shirt, and Pimple’s gold chain to scintillate</p>
<p>enjoying a slim cigarette, musing how my first time, I could be frail</p>
<p>a few inches away, his girl struck chords for one to contemplate</p>
<p>she was beautiful, and made the night slow, then an accelerate</p>
<p>armed men appeared, I was editing pictures, admiring my urbane</p>
<p>for we’d taken photos in the restroom for our profiles’ display</p>
<p>confronting, one snatches my phone, drags me in a trailing abase</p>
<p>outside the venue, he shoved me into his car, I felt like a renegade</p>
<p>I was shaken, a nightmare—it is not my favourite night to recreate</p>
<p>he said nothing, we’d been away for minutes, the silence was grave</p>
<p>returning on the opposing lane, he alights off to shooting in a rain</p>
<p>across the barrier he shot off as other gunshots’ echoes rummaged</p>
<p>a while later he left back for the hotel across, he’d to plant a grenade</p>
<p>I was sure he had one, for the fright stage was a real soul freight</p>
<p>scared in the car alone, clueless in the new silence, I try an escape</p>
<p>furtive, I opened the door, and got out of sight as if to quickly email</p>
<p>this side of the road was lonely, so I went across for the said mail</p>
<p>I hid behind cars by the hotel’s entrance, on their exit, I’d be veiled</p>
<p>on the other lane, his car stood alone and it sure wasn’t a shay</p>
<p>I wasn’t getting married, for the groom had left his bride astray</p>
<p>some more shots went off and he darted out as someone caned</p>
<p>speeding off with the other police men in a mind calming rampage.</p>
<img  alt="Image" class="img-fluid lazy mb-3" src="../../images/loading.gif"  data-src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DbRDYZmMRu/fhw-two/refs/heads/main/books/1965/0001.jpg">

<p>Pimple had left me, still the hotel’s crowd weren’t awry or drained</p>
<p>I got my phone back hours later; the reason of arrest wasn’t plain</p>
<p>no official reason was given, none was convincing, or hit the nail</p>
<p>a dude took me home that night, he said Pimple roused that bane </p>
<p>he was the blabber who tipped the armed men; the story was grey</p>
<p>he added how the hotelier got his guns out just in time to retaliate</p>
<p>all night he smoked pot, with his house on a course to dilapidate</p>
<p>he complained about his old mother, it was our convo’s punctuate</p>
<p>she, his doom in life, he believed he wasn’t birthed, but arraigned</p>
<p>his whining dragged for a while, and I refused his indignance plate</p>
<p>as I was sleepy, I did get to sleep, but not without his rant’s delay</p>
<p>when the day broke, he led me to Pimple’s house like an associate</p>
<p>he’d claimed he knew Pimple, as if his identity wasn’t at all private</p>
<p>not convinced, but for their proximately close residential estates</p>
<p>he said little on our way, having been turgid, maybe not to conflate</p>
<p>by Pimple’s house gate, I saw his patient waiting as if to acculturate</p>
<p>he’d done enough, he’d been nice, but going on was to constipate</p>
<p>I got received and he said bye, I was glad my opinions didn’t remain</p>
<p>my parents arrived, he said, he hadn’t expected the events’ chain.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I knew university could be anything as I could variate</p>
<p>so I often made money on the side without any refrain</p>
<p>making beats, audio mixing, it provided me with a cape</p>
<p>at times resetting stolen or bad devices, I never feigned</p>
<p>opposite my room, drugs got labelled and repackaged</p>
<p>being a famous pot head, whom nothing did infatuate</p>
<p>you’d find me in my room, screen facing past average</p>
<p>a good number were convinced I’d found my own way</p>
<p>come graduation, they saw a repairman in the range</p>
<p>a marketplace fixing phones, hawking, watching napes</p>
<p>convinced I’d be a junkie, slowly become an illiterate</p>
<p>an unfitting conviction for members of my collegiate</p>
<p>but I was making clean dough with no girl to debate</p>
<p>Kendall was my girl; it is something now to cogitate</p>
<p>mull over all of the ways I could come up to narrate</p>
<p>songs, poetry, an essay, didactic novel of a whale.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By third year’s end, their words couldn’t enervate</p>
<p>I’d done work in a marketplace during my intern bay</p>
<p>in a classroom I had no seat in, in there I would pray</p>
<p>for I didn’t want those ties, but a better class of clay</p>
<p>in stream of consciousness, I’d my thoughts detained</p>
<p>I wrote my introspective thoughts in simple language</p>
<p>on weed’s influence, empowering as Samson’s mane</p>
<p>I wasn’t hawking, I was counting down to a detonate</p>
<p>when finally my old ignorance would meet its degrade</p>
<p>I’d break free from inhibitions, restore to my mind, faith.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For a while, I had a pen and a notebook to commentate</p>
<p>so in the store’s inner room, in my own words, I bathed</p>
<p>where repair is done, it is our work you couldn’t negate</p>
<p>for new devices needed some of our service coverage</p>
<p>with the enterprise over three offices in a row, arranged</p>
<p>the store, service room, and the office the boss sits safe</p>
<p>you could walk through the three using some pathway</p>
<p>it connected all three offices through inner doorways</p>
<p>his office led to the corridor, ours was without a linkage</p>
<p>with the store leading outside to the numerous signage</p>
<p>two ladies served our clients, and handled stocktake</p>
<p>in house repairmen with records equalling certificates</p>
<p>we’d two of them, and several apprentices all weekday</p>
<p>Hennessy and the boss on a table they both dictate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Just outside, there was an herbalist facing the populace</p>
<p>I met with him for assistance as I needed help to migrate</p>
<p>I dropped word of my problem hoping it would dissipate</p>
<p>and so weeks later, we left ingredient shopping to create</p>
<p>a more esteemed male member, stocky was its current trait</p>
<p>I hoped it could rise still further; it’d become a fermentate</p>
<p>but no store had what he’d need, a particular plant strain</p>
<p>so we gave up, but it ended in an acquaintanceship glaze.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Portending where I’d end up, I interned at Computer Village</p>
<p>it’s a marketplace where electronics are fixed and are on sale</p>
<p>just a year earlier, a man walked up to me to as if to intimidate</p>
<p>I was visiting for an OS license purchase, and they did assail</p>
<p>the little group hectoring, I told them I was visiting disk pirates</p>
<p>this was my very first gig, a famous actress wanted a webpage</p>
<p>it was second year, a year of solitude, and I was set to manage</p>
<p>for she’d provided little funds for a blog of her press scrapes</p>
<p>he led the group and left me with only enough for my purchase</p>
<p>taking what I’d use for a drink, not my fare, anything to maintain</p>
<p>I continued on my way distraught, and with my naiveties shaled</p>
<p>pulling the roots of the former for sprouts of my new campaign</p>
<p>but a year after my graduation, by a similar, I sought some spade</p>
<p>here is how I lost over two hundred dollars, a covetousness tale</p>
<p>CV, the Village, other names that sure would leave one agape</p>
<p>had a lesson to teach me, but first, laying my earnings to waste</p>
<p>it was upfront payment for a gig, untouched as if cellophaned</p>
<p>that afternoon we arrived convinced we knew how to penetrate</p>
<p>we were there to buy me a phone, same model as my tailing mate</p>
<p>the price a week ago when he got his, had now seen some inflate</p>
<p>clearly a daylight cozenage, so we left the store for an alternate</p>
<p>we ferreted around mumbling of forever and eternity at the rate</p>
<p>ending with a propitiously looking man saying hi in silent sibilate</p>
<p>familiarizing himself with antics, as my mate left us for an enclave</p>
<p>as he, my fat colleague was on a phone call, chattering empaled</p>
<p>we’d left our office for the purchase, hoping I’d get the vantage</p>
<p>showing me an iPhone, off, untrusting, of one that’d been staved </p>
<p>for its active WhatsApp had left me with only this sole insinuate</p>
<p>no phone-monger is ever to win one’s trust, but I needed the avail</p>
<p>oh my, I was the criminal, it’s why it went down in a quick masticate</p>
<p>I headed for the ATM, shooting off well ahead of the triumvirate</p>
<p>withdrew the sum with opposing tellers, then altered my poise’s vein</p>
<p>we all took a slow walk back, all while he spoke as if from a tractate</p>
<p>he’d need to do something, get somewhere, and we’d have to wait</p>
<p>right under a flyover, he hands me the purchased phone, unscathed</p>
<p>I was excited, the long talk I’d had with him felt needless and inane</p>
<p>so I nudge him briskly of haste, to say our chatter almost inundates</p>
<p>I wasn’t waiting, he could be sending cops, and not when I’m satiate</p>
<p>but few steps away, the spurious iPhone I got left me disconsolate</p>
<p>cornered by a slew of ideas, and how he’d gone through to inculcate</p>
<p>it left me dead end downtrodden by my own's cupidity exacerbate</p>
<p>my fat friend hugged me dearly, with everything feeling resupinate</p>
<p>there were no tears as I braced myself, as if my hands would titivate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A new pedlar hanging around thought a final blow would titillate</p>
<p>narrating how he’d been watching, and of the old one’s inveterate</p>
<p>if we’d follow him, he was certain he’d be at an infamous carapace</p>
<p>we soon arrive at a flyblown residence, and I by no way understate</p>
<p>the environs shoved images of debauchery and all they eviscerate</p>
<p>he motioned us down a narrow passage, from the outdoor terrain</p>
<p>the lateral buildings provided a path so tiny in efforts to embrace</p>
<p>assenting his request for the phone as we ascended the gangway</p>
<p>it led to a shut door, so we returned as unfamiliar past the intimate</p>
<p>back outside from the path, he also had taken off with not a trace</p>
<p>his arms squashed mine in a hug as I pondered the other in sublate</p>
<p>a ghetto was the road’s end, devoid of hope, let alone the roseate</p>
<p>we headed for a famous bar dubbed Shrine with nothing to litigate</p>
<p>we both smoked pot, we called it a day, a day lending to incarcerate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Before internship, I’d lost ice cream, not watch my phone incinerate</p>
<p>an in house repairman thought my music taste, Brit electropop an A</p>
<p>he’d meant, I’d like Dagny and XCX and all their music I’d accumulate</p>
<p>we went out a lot, on the best errands, he was cute boy, and I was ray</p>
<p>at a service station, waiting for the rain and my weed high to deflate</p>
<p>slothfully, a squalidly robed prophet trudged past us as if maimed</p>
<p>with a big bible under his arm, he was begging, he looked untamed</p>
<p>also uncouth, questioning cute boy, for unlike others he is fake</p>
<p>to me at least, he isn’t the senior colleague who is too obstinate</p>
<p>he was to the junior repairmen, I being the only undergraduate</p>
<p>the question evades me now, the muses, not even a paraphrase</p>
<p>in deterrence he admonished, pointing out the obvious luxate</p>
<p>and I introspected on, his cue being money, the slyest arcane</p>
<p>ever true to these words, a thing always to exchange for bail.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My growth as a programmer staunched reasons I could quail</p>
<p>so also my reputation from student’s projects providing slake</p>
<p>it meant, with my degree conferred, I wasn’t getting displaced</p>
<p>no village for me, I could get a job in the field I’d been trained</p>
<p>in my hall, Taylor Swift’s 1989 spelled my mood’s aggregate</p>
<p>with Owl City’s Mobile Orchestra, the confluence of lakes</p>
<p>with the album’s theme matching my graduation in a pre-date</p>
<p>every song bore relevance, with one going on to congratulate</p>
<p>the close to heart tropes, consider how I’ve never used a bidet</p>
<p>and in this world around me, an invite to meet the one I simulate</p>
<p>my final year had me screaming, o, we live in a virtual world, hey!</p>
<p>not quite descriptive of the phenomenon, but an instantiate</p>
<p>it’s the year my focus became intentional as if gripping reins</p>
<p>averting all else, my eyes clocked most new hours with belay</p>
<p>this stumble of the brain’s power in mood roused an inflate</p>
<p>for it would save me years later when abusing crack-cocaine</p>
<p>a reminder of natural hyper awareness put me in retrograde</p>
<p>I fought my weed dependency, and finally shut the gateway.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Final year; second year using, just weed and I mean heavy usage</p>
<p>I made a fortune from my colleagues’ finals, my hidden accolade</p>
<p>I remember fixing a bug, just moments, that’d give me an advantage</p>
<p>I had built a web spider for my final project, just before I’d illustrate</p>
<p>the fix meant queries displayed images if present to a fine culminate</p>
<p>but I got a B, my gig clients got As, I was uncovering a grade rape</p>
<p>my studying habits had improved, and I was certain I wouldn’t fail</p>
<p>but the public grade records were attempts I didn't rewrite assuaged</p>
<p>on the college noticeboard anyone could read the clear downgrade</p>
<p>their plot to downplay my efforts, so they don’t add up or cumulate</p>
<p>for an unserious student, if I ever was, I had nothing to stir up tirade</p>
<p>for my track record, it offered a loss of grip on the educational stale</p>
<p>a well-managed institutionalized gaslighting, the crooked and chicane</p>
<p>maybe I was too busy to study, a pothead skipping classes in grace</p>
<p>a particular lecturer’s guise not to fail me, was inexistent to very faint</p>
<p>I met him in his office to complain of the impossible, of the disarray</p>
<p>as always, he wore a smug demeanour, an air of language intemperate</p>
<p>his speech saw his lips jumble and with his lower teeth caries collocate</p>
<p>showing me his records across courses he took, chewing a tribal adage </p>
<p>his records showed I’d few points away from what could be attained</p>
<p>simple courses knowledgeable to one practicing, nothing souterrain </p>
<p>his scores showed As, disparate from my grades in the IT database</p>
<p>I’d need to pay to retrieve my scripts, then meet the academic senate</p>
<p>he’d probably said, record Es, he’d take me seriously, his namesake</p>
<p>he answered to my natural parent’s surname, and I was that candidate</p>
<p>I’d need money, but my natural dad’s indifference left me too amazed</p>
<p>it brought a wave of questioning, it’d all been for nothing in the main</p>
<p>thanks to the lecturer from the US with bad English, smile, and brain.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The English lecturer I bet did exactly the same</p>
<p>she made it look like a come of age soul stain</p>
<p>the music lecturer also with a flunk to insinuate</p>
<p>I am a secretly leaking trail to a brain drain</p>
<p>a charge my current effort has debased</p>
<p>what they thought did, never had me fazed</p>
<p>not until trauma hit and I responded in slate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Both first and final year had glops of unneeded strain</p>
<p>as a fresher because I expected a porous membrane</p>
<p>finals 'cause I thought the system was out and flamed </p>
<p>at no point did I fit well in the motley—here is my claim</p>
<p>I was too early, now late; all wrong, nothing was certain</p>
<p>when the final days came of documenting and bye waves</p>
<p>mine was with my tall man fixated at the institution's taste</p>
<p>I was designing a publishing platform, my baby, their grail</p>
<p>it got me my first job, without the necessary sign shapes</p>
<p>I got an NDA but settled on not liking the office paint.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>First year was my unbridled free exploring in naïveté</p>
<p>stripped in the corridor, bible in hand, I’d enunciate </p>
<p>reading aloud Psalm 109, damning off stolen cabbage</p>
<p>a friend’s stolen phone, any theft that’d caused damage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With the first semester ended, we created some straits</p>
<p>by we, I mean I, and my friends by the helm to navigate</p>
<p>maybe my butt-naked cursing allured the magical lane</p>
<p>as a teen, I dabbled briefly into Satanism just to obviate</p>
<p>no more than curdled boredom that wouldn’t evaporate</p>
<p>I read occultic books, held forum accounts in the strange</p>
<p>and I still had no clue, just an upside down cross disparage</p>
<p>and here was an invite to be amused in the real deal quake</p>
<p>pay some money to get graded only distinctions straight</p>
<p>it was a pen writing its own answers, telling the day’s date</p>
<p>it was his promise to us, we could all rest assured, it’d allay</p>
<p>my first semester was great, I studied for it, I didn’t hesitate</p>
<p>but our stumble on new esoteric books brought on a decay</p>
<p>and plus I started making beats, indulging short of moderate</p>
<p>making the fanciful idea an exemplar of lemon turned lemonade</p>
<p>but my fears rose with his money requests, others were enraged</p>
<p>talks of high prices from the seller and the funds now being gage</p>
<p>so the pens never arrived, and he asked for lecturers’ surnames</p>
<p>our worries were up, but in no way did our beliefs decimate</p>
<p>no one said a thing, for we all knew in an enlightened alligate</p>
<p>in our own quarters, quiet in thought, with desires inordinate</p>
<p>hell was close, so was this tunnel’s end, nothing could withsay</p>
<p>he suggested clever charms and prayers, and gullible, we paid</p>
<p>of everyone in the litter, I cannot unbashfully pick out any saint</p>
<p>I believe they are all stooges; I can tell that now, young knaves</p>
<p>round the clock, putting up façades, all five of them, correlates</p>
<p>but for the one who’d introduced him to us, made us birdbrains</p>
<p>left me hungry at night, old clothes on my back set for wreckage</p>
<p>it would only take time for me to see, and call out his machinate</p>
<p>I just wanted my smarts way up, to get some honey like she gave</p>
<p>younger, my natural mum provided honey charms for the phase</p>
<p>it was just honey; no extra items and it worked in matching gait.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Looking back at the long line of contacts without any breakage</p>
<p>Code Pb Dad, as it appears on my phone, a boutade dunnage</p>
<p>reimagining him away from his family and friends, his syndicate</p>
<p>a prophet with dreads, he’d his own home in a scene of foliage</p>
<p>he made enough from us for his wife to start a provisions retail</p>
<p>my first year bunkie introduced me to a senior with big courage</p>
<p>it was the idea as we discussed the spooky by the dark’s blade</p>
<p>he, the senior in turn, introduced me to another to encourage</p>
<p>and so I met Mercy, just below Code Pb Dad in the peerage</p>
<p>the bunkie, the senior, wait for it, Mercy, meet his confederates.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You probably suspect already; the senior is a total flake</p>
<p>one year ahead, campus famous and is one to inoculate</p>
<p>another roommate detested him, everything for his sake</p>
<p>he perceived him shamming, and an old barraging snake</p>
<p>the polyp nosed political student whose brain is frayed</p>
<p>everyone called him Baboo, it was his known soubriquet</p>
<p>he gave me a handkerchief that had my roommate afraid</p>
<p>it’d weird symbols on it, my roomie wasn’t new in the maze</p>
<p>he’d done a blood covenant once, as far back as a decade</p>
<p>a love oath with a long dead girlfriend, it’s what it became</p>
<p>she hunted him, her ghost, her voice, neither well or sane</p>
<p>until he visited his ancestral shrine far away to remancipate</p>
<p>for they both had sucked the other’s blood like beverage</p>
<p>a Casanova, he’d giggled straight from crying like a drake</p>
<p>with the call muted, his laughter implored we too habituate</p>
<p>he then said, it’s okay to fuck every girl, it’s why I’m awake</p>
<p>I wasn’t convinced he’d a scare, he instead had a message</p>
<p>Baboo is lame, furthering his judgement with my luggage</p>
<p>you’ve met my roomie from Poem 108, Einstein, Faraday?</p>
<p>he thought up the whole experience, it’s been his predicate</p>
<p>ladies and gentlemen, the revealing lines bearing his telltale</p>
<p>I should thank him, he’s helped me to centre, and articulate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He gave me books in the past that helped me to meditate</p>
<p>an eastern monk in New York who offered one a portage</p>
<p>teachings to embrace suffering, and desires, to attenuate</p>
<p>then I found stoicism; the smooth transition and translate</p>
<p>flaunty, if he never read any one himself, too unfortunate</p>
<p>to be stuck in the mirror phase, a rather pernicious vitiate</p>
<p>our opinions differ, he shuns the empirical for “the planes”</p>
<p>in his world, there are seven heavens, not seeing shrinkage</p>
<p>where the demons conduct research then send out relays.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’d riffled through C.S. Lewis’s the letters from Screwtape</p>
<p>It’s all I have on demons, but he’d books one would wildly gaze</p>
<p>it’s a certain plane, then unintelligibly he’d continue to narrate</p>
<p>trying to get people on his ideas, I’d muse on as if to speculate</p>
<p>it didn’t feel right, they were fanciful, airhead’s ideas to iterate</p>
<p>by nature, when speaking, even to his friends, he would orate</p>
<p>his brash voluble spiel seemed to go on in charlatan raves</p>
<p>and when one knew about the issue, he acted with disdain</p>
<p>questioning only lead to him meandering, never to expatiate</p>
<p>his devotees referred to him as Machiavelli in the heydays.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Out of university, I was sliving where I could incubate</p>
<p>the coder in his office, then I saw what he portrayed</p>
<p>beyond his pretentiousness, I saw the addlebrained</p>
<p>a thief, a barnacled liar, with only that to perpetrate</p>
<p>it took a Facebook post for my hunch to perpetuate</p>
<p>posing for pictures by a desk as if to claim the palisade</p>
<p>caption, righteousness got him a job, with images to indicate</p>
<p>before his exit, he told me he’d need money for an assemblage</p>
<p>a man of God could help with his nose polyp, out to negotiate</p>
<p>I gave him money, no fare—for he went nowhere—to acclimate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Freshmen, we’d special prayers from a book for a foretaste</p>
<p>recited before dawn, silence for holy names in interchange</p>
<p>we all adhered, and to our incredulity, in the test we all aced</p>
<p>it’s a mandatary after class examination, a MCQ designate</p>
<p>I’d the best score in class, a point short, and got a handshake.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My dean, a physicist got mad I never stuck to the rail</p>
<p>he loved my name, but I got ever impersonal in full spate</p>
<p>I even started missing the tests, quitting the reg brigade</p>
<p>I think he knew me as, “O Theophilus!” he’d call to begay</p>
<p>he could have helped me, but I was resigned and obdurate</p>
<p>a dull friend hit a jackpot score, laying his former in wastage</p>
<p>that’s the bunkie who acquainted me with the king of tutelage</p>
<p>with our scores in line, we agreed the book to be consecrate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Baboo ruined his brain, so we all needed ancestral aids</p>
<p>I spent exam nights making beats, chomping Kool-Aids</p>
<p>with the pens not making it, I only had to trust the gale</p>
<p>the odd one that blows you cougar as you walk in gains</p>
<p>headed for the exam hall where memory is enough game</p>
<p>second semester, first year, the mysterious to excavate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>First semester was three points, next, two point eight</p>
<p>committing my charms alone, it could have been great</p>
<p>but I let Baboo ruin it all, and have me sozzled on ale. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I had no one calling me soppy names</p>
<p>no cute masculine ones I can restate</p>
<p>maybe with their doors closed to fixate</p>
<p>I did have girls after me in literal chase</p>
<p>I mean it, every time I was hard to locate</p>
<p>I was a celeb, circle police, razor shaved</p>
<p>high style threads, to ransom—the stage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The student whose ways, sways to daze</p>
<p>fam or fan? do you, what do you say?</p>
<p>how do you identify? no long hangnails</p>
<p>remember him or the cougar’s delicate?</p>
<p>his name was Fan-u, right? this is okay</p>
<p>it was sophomore he became a roommate</p>
<p>or is it Fam-u? oh of these day’s vulgate</p>
<p>it could have been his name, a shame</p>
<p>it is, he should sue, balk out my lame. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ah! I had others, two more bed frames</p>
<p>Pimple, a junkie dude, and a squat splay</p>
<p>the junkie we called Cassette in homage</p>
<p>to his early music slips and oldie storage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I later left for another; some blocks faraway</p>
<p>for a room all to myself, until the last quake</p>
<p>of stealth visitors, well covetous to extirpate</p>
<p>so I had a meeting that led to an abrogate</p>
<p>one over myself, in my head, a final cascade</p>
<p>the final decision was for me to repatriate</p>
<p>for the regular arrangement that’d placate</p>
<p>or it’d be my Dell PC, if they collaborate</p>
<p>I’d lost a USB modem in a rut clean rake</p>
<p>it’d been a pianist fingers’ harrowing sate</p>
<p>ratted by one whose admittance is insane</p>
<p>sparking interest in his rood seat to imitate</p>
<p>ever worried of my weed high in longing vale</p>
<p>both church pianist through the congregate</p>
<p>sat up in the chancel with the most bandage</p>
<p>old living epistles salvaged from a mucky raid. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>For their personalities, if you give or take</p>
<p>one scrunched the nose and took the pain</p>
<p>other lost bridge and is tootles for change</p>
<p>infatuated by reeking fingers and going ape</p>
<p>the only one who told me, I only do opiates</p>
<p>I’d be a different man if his crowd ‘d swathed</p>
<p>my weed habit would be alive and desperate</p>
<p>Mr. history, mystery, on a song I nicknamed</p>
<p>a friend of Baboo, ours differed in its vein.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We’d a bet, to fingerbang, to prove I wasn’t tamed</p>
<p>her big sis let me to too, my move was to ingratiate</p>
<p>two sisters, one hotel, good enough to substantiate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Of a late catch up on who needed to propitiate</p>
<p>my phone was missing this time, the scene taped</p>
<p>campus back then, was an anti-smartphone space</p>
<p>leastways, until the bigot dean got with his dotage</p>
<p>soon, a jolly philosopher got his desired post aim</p>
<p>the new dean soon delivered the role’s new package</p>
<p>his short, endomorph habitus was a good instantiate</p>
<p>his mild thrash talk was awesome in advent of a shake</p>
<p>his daughter was a student, oh her ass beguiling pace</p>
<p>too thick, with height from dad and all that pertained</p>
<p>at the beginning, it was the centre of all the exudate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With my smartphone gone, I pondered the trick in play</p>
<p>I had no roommates, wasn't careless, with a lock in place</p>
<p>the buddy who'd come, sing lullabies as he’d, so regaled</p>
<p>wasn't on my acrid blacklist, the fella could pass for gay</p>
<p>a seemingly gay man won't steal, not a buddy, do they?</p>
<p>but when the confession broke, from the horse it came</p>
<p>it was a shocker, that no one but him could help palliate</p>
<p>I expected him to help, but not a word from him to wane</p>
<p>his unsuspecting tooshie had done the hand-hang crane?</p>
<p>will I forget Owl City fireflies? damn putz he almost ate. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>After the theft, I moved on, leaving a skitter trail</p>
<p>same block, the opposite room for security detail</p>
<p>ten years older, counting, ATM his sound grate</p>
<p>I needed someone older and with arms to excoriate</p>
<p>I assumed he’d gotten the name as a local magnate</p>
<p>adding from his lifestyle, too improbable and hearsay</p>
<p>or a rich kid, and sure I knew he wasn’t anyway staid</p>
<p>he’d told me stories of girlfriends’ visits and prim lays</p>
<p>of wasted years at other universities and of that pain</p>
<p>lethal fights, bloodshed, reasons he’d made me a cage</p>
<p>I felt lucky, and for a lot of people it was intense hate</p>
<p>he helped me score a record seven, in clean gradates</p>
<p>seamless, that number of girls on me, their male stake</p>
<p>it felt super good, I woke up feeling like an alpha male</p>
<p>nothing held me back, unrestricted in the following days</p>
<p>summer break arrived, and a girlfriend refused a hug eh?</p>
<p>you could, but when was the last time you buzzed babe?</p>
<p>he had left that out, and he wasn’t anywhere to mediate</p>
<p>she was leaving my home, no kissing, it had been a parley</p>
<p>also his name—an initialism—leaned towards the profane</p>
<p>as a pothead years later, he showed his nay and distaste</p>
<p>so we’d a fall out, I wasn’t a bad kid, a sort of young mage</p>
<p>out alone at night, watching the stars twinkling softly back</p>
<p>it was just recently I got word from the world of the literate</p>
<p>a book that name-drops Paris Hilton as porn’s playmate</p>
<p>it described it as ass-to-mouth, ATM for zero verbiage</p>
<p>it was a very wonderful stumble, I thought it pretty savage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His room unlike Fanu's, was a no grit, clean state</p>
<p>his roomie, a real life giant on his own thought train </p>
<p>with love for making beats, and a basketball inmate</p>
<p>was wishful, loved his mum and deplored eating steak</p>
<p>I hardly knew the guy, when around quite the loud bait </p>
<p>I never saw him make a beat under all that outweighed</p>
<p>and when he was in, it was talk, sleep, and demonstrate</p>
<p>but before I left Famu’s room, there was a scary tale.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was a day like every other, I was out by my fate</p>
<p>with matters to attend to, for a whole day of trade</p>
<p>ID cards were being issued; I’d the day to dedicate</p>
<p>for weeks, I let the rush pass, as the famed reprobate</p>
<p>only I call myself lackadaisical, bearing my martingale</p>
<p>weighing importance tactically, it’s the way to graduate</p>
<p>a Christian university and it’s high morals they proclaim.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’d mine now and lunchtime came hitting me with a mace</p>
<p>I headed for the canteen carried in hunger’s plumage</p>
<p>a few minutes from the admin building sits its terrace</p>
<p>I’d pass by the computer lab and colleges for a flambé</p>
<p>but no flambé though, it was about to be a robinsonade</p>
<p>Fanu would need a statement, it’d entail how to forsake</p>
<p>for he was about to hand me casted fetters of bondage</p>
<p>his bank balance was about to reveal his true portrait.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Using WiFi in the foyer before the stairs, the interface</p>
<p>our eyes met, he’d just arrived, that didn’t need an essay</p>
<p>he was looking himself, formal, smart, and as appropriate</p>
<p>the semesters had toned mine down, leaving me desiccate</p>
<p>if I was female, against the rules I’d still dress up a bit risqué</p>
<p>he’d shocked me a semester ago with what he purveyed</p>
<p>behind me, he’d made available to a colleague my suitcase</p>
<p>the fat dude with me the day I got swindled, it’s depraved</p>
<p>for he knew I owned the bag, my bad I flunked the presage</p>
<p>I retched out my plans to him in a reflection dispassionate</p>
<p>he’d told me he’d need to run a quick errand to my dismay</p>
<p>I said I was peckish, and if by his minutes, and to numerate</p>
<p>five should be five, no returning to telling me stories ornate</p>
<p>he assured me leaving no later wouldn’t be at all an abdicate</p>
<p>nonetheless he would return on time, in an averring grimace</p>
<p>I told him I’d leave if I’d to, but he reassured me in a palpate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Alone as the silence watched uncertain of its own pervade</p>
<p>a familiar face walked past and there was a normal exchange</p>
<p>five minutes turned to six with no sign of him, no coruscate</p>
<p>I looked through the windows, employing the nearby dais</p>
<p>but no one was coming, my terms hadn’t been inchoate</p>
<p>leaving it even with his word to, would leave me to blame</p>
<p>it left me pensive, stuck unlike the Bible’s waiting maids</p>
<p>I had no bag so I couldn’t leave with it, I felt like a glaik</p>
<p>I walked away, no flinch, conscience clear by my undertake.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hours later he caught me in an ambush, where he waylaid</p>
<p>he’d accusing questions, and no care at all to disambiguate</p>
<p>these things never feel real, I thought in my slow repudiate       </p>
<p>I told him I wasn’t in the room with it, as if in expected cliché</p>
<p>I left as per our agreement, I cleared, convinced it’d exculpate</p>
<p>tagging me in a theft report? I’d add, of the type haemorrhage</p>
<p>he’d eyewitnesses accounts of my leaving with an appendage</p>
<p>and of seeing it in our room, he closed swiftly to accentuate</p>
<p>in a calming disbelief I snap at him in an assertive remonstrate</p>
<p>he’d gone too far; his accounts were wrong and also glacé</p>
<p>he’d alibis, I’d none, but I couldn’t afford the verbal tentage</p>
<p>he’d set me against an open block for anyone to castigate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At the bench with every reason for his testimony to fluctuate </p>
<p>things took a decisive turn, as he left things out to abnegate</p>
<p>there’d been no alibis, which for me was a winning ameliorate</p>
<p>when I called his attention, he slunk on in a baffling prevaricate</p>

<p>and afterwards losing all in subsidence</p>
<p>of my new family, a beautiful epaulette</p>

<p>I’d my phone back from the intransigent</p>

<p>shortest road to a wannabe, the easiest </p>

<p>one of my friends, and pin-up coquettes</p>
<p>of twenty five songs in two months pelt</p>

<p>gifting Taylor Swift, for not being tactless</p>
<p>saying I love her with the title as diadem</p>

<p>In the toilet, only one name felt munificent</p>
<p>having enough feeding up my biasedness</p>
<p>Kendall Jenner ‘d seen to my commitment</p>
<p>with assurance of her personal involvement</p>
<p>being the first off the family arborescence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Kendall was like Kylie with reverie consent</p>
<p>those years ago with weekdays like weekend</p>
<p>new to smoking weed, and I’d just graduated</p>
<p>Kylie had my eye, but I’d have to be soulless</p>
<p>it’s like a crush for infanta Sofia; real hotbed</p>
<p>to feed my desire as so would be carelessness</p>
<p>and I’d ‘ve ‘d to settle for cheap meretriciousness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Keeping Up with the Kardashians had an omen</p>
<p>for me those years ago, it was one thing it blared</p>
<p>in the end it’d be on me for dying in a grotty stent.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I caught the right episode for my primitiveness</p>
<p>so Kendall was the ever busy, always absent</p>
<p>the family member I surreptitiously emulated</p>
<p>ever putting in work, by myself with loneliness</p>
<p>I probably ‘ve a different idea-memory indent</p>
<p>but all that wealth inspired in me true sweat</p>
<p>I wanted a day I’d have it truly, real opulence</p>
<p>I wasn’t convinced it’d be early in my adultness</p>
<p>but a decent life, one also free from turbulence </p>
<p>I wanted this badly for my kids, no settlement </p>
<p>a middle aged man living in his kid’s merriment</p>
<p>if I tried I could hit my goal by my impatience.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was some months ago she’d lent me patience</p>
<p>easy, being her, since I had a sort of blindness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Following a brave act, I was left in dependence</p>
<p>caved in, and she provided emotional stipends</p>
<p>as I’d ran away from home, by self-insistence</p>
<p>extempore, full throttle, as would enjambment</p>
<p>to rid myself of all forms of every derailment</p>
<p>maybe I’d flourish, then get on emoluments.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It wasn’t the first time I was that overwhelmed</p>
<p>years ago I’d skedaddled in apprehensiveness</p>
<p>ending up in Ghana from tough indecisiveness</p>
<p>I’d failed freshman exams from unseriousness</p>
<p>having arrived with a very embarrassing closet</p>
<p>clothing giving away my fashion tastelessness</p>
<p>no hip t-shirts; plain flannel, or trendy footwear </p>
<p>so I played truant as I had my articles rotated</p>
<p>with Sundays with the week’s classes avoided</p>
<p>so the session’s time-table ended shirk infested.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When my results got mailed, it awoke insurgence</p>
<p>I hid the envelope and all its incredulous content</p>
<p>it was luck to have gotten a hold of the shipment</p>
<p>for me, if you asked, questioned, it was inexistent</p>
<p>but fees can’t get paid without accomplishments</p>
<p>as merely getting a promotion won’t be sufficient</p>
<p>my natural dad convinced, thought to visit clueless</p>
<p>campus ‘d be closer to the rat for the telling smell.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With everyone else out, the perfect development</p>
<p>for a high school sendoff, I started my movement</p>
<p>I packed a bag, my passport, nicked a subtrahend</p>
<p>my laptop, and a pocket dictionary, it was French</p>
<p>a roommate had told me he’d be switching college</p>
<p>we all ‘d issues with courses not being accredited</p>
<p>his plan was for Ghana, so I left home as a ferret</p>
<p>soon at the borderline where I crossed o'er lawless</p>
<p>it was a one week trip of favours and encroachment</p>
<p>I was in Ghana the next day, arriving through Lome</p>
<p>and I returned following my resolution’s detachment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Impromptu, not dissimilar in manner as I’d left</p>
<p>better than the last scarper in a hat contest</p>
<p>I prepared for the worst, its every exactness</p>
<p>and sleeping out in the open, it constituted</p>
<p>I wasn’t dismayed the night of its occurrence</p>
<p>being driven out of a mosque was antecedent</p>
<p>and I got a place the next day from kindness</p>
<p>but several kilometres and towns separated.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’d fled for the mental cruelty I couldn’t bear</p>
<p>but first, sold my washer-dryer and tv in prep</p>
<p>also, an audio interface priced ridiculousness</p>
<p>it was how I raised the money for my pocket.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I phoned a uni roomie for his familiar address</p>
<p>I’d worked in the town his house was situated</p>
<p>for over a year, I was a neighbouring resident</p>
<p>so he provided me a realtor for an apartment</p>
<p>by moving I was undoing my initial gullibleness</p>
<p>for my natural parents had been impediments</p>
<p>squashing my efforts to scale up my business</p>
<p>everything linked to them ‘d been inconsistent</p>
<p>and they’d succeeded at my old career arrest</p>
<p>brought to halt with attentive deliberateness</p>
<p>their aim was to see any future plan thwarted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When I met the realtor I was disappointed</p>
<p>if only for the certainty he had over the cell</p>
<p>before leaving home, I’d told him my budget</p>
<p>but his prices had spiked up and were unfair</p>
<p>he’d invited me down to meet the unexpected.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I remained with my old roomie as I was stranded</p>
<p>with two weeks gone, I had to end being his guest</p>
<p>informing my natural parents couldn’t be checked</p>
<p>I was a runaway and left all backtracking unattended</p>
<p>and for his parents, there was no hiding of profess</p>
<p>drug-mongers alike, also by their own subservience</p>
<p>the usual speakers outside showed their full pledge</p>
<p>I had them in my room at home, as if all over my neck</p>
<p>whatever they are, these close telepathy equipment</p>
<p>all who use them, are a part of the Anon in reference</p>
<p>voices responding to my thought is their department</p>
<p>I was about three months at home when it all started</p>
<p>it was during a relapse and since then it hasn’t ended</p>
<p>the voices follow everywhere, with motion they extend.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I left his home with no place in mind but complacent</p>
<p>anywhere away from what the cult group had to sell</p>
<p>deprivation of human rights in the culture is inherent</p>
<p>in transit I exchanged series of emails in the context</p>
<p>discussing absurdities I faced and what challenged</p>
<p>a copy to Hollywood, another to a British poetess</p>
<p>Jess and Charly Cox, with the former in indigence</p>
<p>spam lovers; Jess shared my mails, ever so efficient</p>
<p>and the latter with a caucus convinced that I’m gifted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I discovered Gemma Styles and her judgement</p>
<p>her podcasts were of interest, so I commenced</p>
<p>I listened to the new episodes with curiousness</p>
<p>few episodes in, I met Charly in her stylishness</p>
<p>she spoke on mental health definition relentless</p>
<p>I slept with both voices providing me relentment</p>
<p>all night, easing me into a different atmosphere</p>
<p>away from the Anon’s noise and interference.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A picture of Gemma and Harry ‘d me captivated</p>
<p>you ‘ve to take pictures with her, so my mind went</p>
<p>I’ve been in love since, and why hasn’t it dissipated?</p>
<p>Because at first blush, a rummaging tide got melted</p>
<p>and for her mum, Anne Twist, dad, and their friends</p>
<p>after my first published work, I lost some skittishness</p>
<p>foremost, it's because of their British encouragement.</p>

 <p>Chloe Burcham is a friend of Gemma in the press</p>
<p>her body ‘d me, her boobs looked overly succulent </p>
<p>so on a retreat at Bali I asked my dad and begged</p>
<p>Chloe told me I could come, there’d be edutainment</p>
<p>but I couldn’t make it, for work, away from the gel</p>
<p>looking back at it, from her range, it was fleechment</p>
<p>it’s her face, I blame them, luring me into fatuousness</p>
<p>but whenever we’d do it, we can both cry entrapment.</p>

<p>Charly’s poems and stories hung on sombreness</p>
<p>so days later I made a song to rouse cheerfulness</p>
<p>to abate her suicide themes for some excitement</p>
<p>with her late grandad’s posts being the grimmest.</p>

<p>so it was fun reading her messages unanticipated</p>

<p>I arrived a day later in a town, miles off, and secluded</p>
<p>its locations boasted better, and wider circumference</p>
<p>and my bedroom was conducive for reading, even sex</p>
<p>with Charly’s poke, I’d A Rainy Day from the drafted</p>

<p>aunty in August 19 ‘d her off day, and I was in debt</p>
<p>so the day before I’d avoided her for any food item</p>
<p>it was a big shock in the morning to find her nowhere</p>
<p>and with no knowledge of her ever being elsewhere</p>
<p>late that day, the poem filled my empty kitchenette</p>
<p>around the time she arrived, I’d found my fulfilment</p>
<p>she told me she’d come around for her army clientele</p>
<p>the next day, I was just glad my hunger ‘d be quenched</p>
<p>I later sold my laptop to a soldier, as per etiquette</p>
<p>it helped me travel and provided disembarrassment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She was a mother of one; a girl in her childishness</p>
<p>her hubby drove a cab, I met only kind-heartedness</p>
<p>on my fist arrival, I met her by a reading assignment</p>
<p>they’d employed a teenage teacher by their sproglet </p>
<p>she told me they were poor, still it was hospitableness</p>
<p>we had long chats that were the first since unaddicted</p>
<p>the surrounding silence gifted me with new comportment</p>
<p>with time by myself, reading and meditating it slowly bred.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I told Lisa of Blackpink about a farmstead</p>
<p>a campaign for my amorous advancements </p>
<p>she wanted a house; I thought up a duplex</p>
<p>a farmhouse, it’d be a friendship monument</p>
<p>erected in the town, it’d see her in ebullience</p>
<p>but that was months before I met tenderness</p>

<p>but I’d love to say thank you, give reimbursement</p>

<p>and under the guise of a member of a recruitment</p>

<p>happier than ever, by my sobriety in mundaneness</p>
<p>happy for the winks in her video’s empty end pixels</p>
<p>a lost cause if I’d remained at home? Who can tell?</p>

 <p>With glasses clinking weeks earlier, I’d celebrated</p>
<p>it was a year of abstinence, no substance interest </p>
<p>and here I was, like a Spanish undercover agent</p>
<p>with files no one ‘d understand, in forsakenness</p>
<p>or I’d been left in drill, one of intentional madness</p>
<p>for these celebs knew me, but I sure wasn’t a celeb</p>
<p>Folklore and Evermore were the reminding threats</p>
<p>I joined the Illuminati with my first mixtape’s incept</p>
<p>but I soon soaked in them anyway, in Fearless</p>
<p>that cruel summer, I was fearless, it’s undisputed.</p>

 <p>Earlier, Jess had wanted me going earless</p>
<p>I was then with my uni colleague in transience</p>
<p>at my first stop, by the planned temporariness</p>
<p>her move was for earmuffs I had in my basket</p>
<p>checking out the earlier wished procurement</p>
<p>to curb the telepathic response persistence</p>
<p>as they followed me everywhere and flooded</p>
<p>it could end the barrage with me the recipient</p>
<p>but I spent the money, and I’m not a bonehead</p>
<p>I was just a year clean, that was my happiness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Faraway and alone, in all the vulnerableness</p>
<p>it was when I saw her again, my tv’s empress </p>
<p>on X, just in time, with new pictures posted</p>
<p>images in sync and speaking to my problem</p>
<p>as if thought reading in acknowledgement.</p>

<p>She rescued me twice to my embarrassment</p>
<p>killing depression, I sought nothing to assess</p>
<p>leaving me with my chin up as if now to accept</p>
<p>I was starting a new journey, one also matchless</p>
<p>and with my favourite amongst business women.</p>

 <p>So with months salaries totally exempted</p>
<p>with my content in trend and represented</p>
<p>a name relevant from a sharpening acumen</p>
<p>swift question responses, one to commend</p>
<p>she convinced me of the weird shrewdness</p>
<p>so I marched on, ridding disappointments</p>
<p>returning home with poems o'er a hundred</p>
<p>in time for Kris Jenner to hand me a ticket</p>
<p>a book tour of China and Asia if repented</p>
<p>I’d ‘ve the bag, with the job done and dusted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What then was the job was some new inquest</p>
<p>for I made music, and wrote poetry relentless</p>
<p>it was a countdown to discovering the salient</p>
<p>for these questions were always the hardest</p>
<p>they came with responses that bore oddness</p>
<p>as I’d ask whenever too financially decumbent</p>
<p>away from this, being busy is the air concept</p>
<p>ten poetry publications later, I feel prepared.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I returned September from the summer quest</p>
<p>my first night of the summer ‘d a welkin of Eden</p>
<p>with clear bright stars glowing phosphorescent</p>
<p>I arrived in the strange town to the consentient</p>
<p>a Yoruba town called Otun, right if translated</p>
<p>over there I found mind peace in a long silence</p>
<p>and though living was rough, it served as crèche</p>
<p>a month of nature’s noisy orchestra, the citadel</p>
<p>far from my natural parents, enjoying rustic quiet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A year later Chantel brought up the renascence</p>
<p>introducing me to Toyin Abraham, a produceress</p>
<p>I also met Kolawole Ajeyemi and the management</p>
<p>meeting the Ajeyemis meant I’d get some payment</p>
<p>he’d be handling my salary and updates on targets</p>
<p>it was consolation with a local for the time to collect.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But I didn’t return home at first, being a rebel</p>
<p>I was back where I’d worked, I did so in stealth</p>
<p>for the town wove job offers in a better breadth</p>
<p>and I wanted a shot, until I hit the poem channel</p>
<p>it’s the story in Poem 108, in there is knowledge</p>
<p>so Baboo ‘d a hunch, and for this ‘d me ejected</p>
<p>certain I wasn’t skint, it left him in despondence</p>
<p>to the only one who’d take me in, I turned a pest</p>
<p>I’d a fight with everyone and recoiled to my hell</p>
<p>but not the same, no, this Frith was rejuvenated.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In thought, my memories of Jessica felt rutted</p>
<p>especially with my equipment’s reducing driblet</p>
<p>she too ‘d been generous with her voluntariness</p>
<p>she’d lascivious photos posts that were flawless</p>
<p>her images beat trauma, and got me entrenched</p>
<p>I can’t say we’re still a thing, take it as a sketch.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our journey started in a heartbreak statement</p>
<p>that’s her debut album; Electric was the stem</p>
<p>she was also on Logic’s mixtape cover; evident</p>
<p>Bobby Tarantino II, but I saw just some model</p>
<p>on a particular Facebook API service, its spec</p>
<p>the cover was in exemplification and documented</p>
<p>it also is memorious for Wiz Khalifa’s presence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I always called weed KK to be sophisticated</p>
<p>all of the guys knew this, no one was incensed</p>
<p>I’d smoke it someday, but no one is prescient</p>
<p>it was after graduation, I really sought progress</p>
<p>soon I’d a load of guys around me, I was a gent</p>
<p>those were the early days before disbandment</p>
<p>so no KK smoking ever, there will be no digress</p>
<p>Elon Musk won’t have it, as much luxuriousness</p>
<p>I’ve been avoiding addicts, for I’m not indifferent</p>
<p>the recovery program insisted on this for success.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I remember Wiz K as a Swifty in a gang extend</p>
<p>a word from Taylor, but Taylor Gang directed</p>
<p>the billionaire was happy I survived all that sess</p>
<p>the unhealthy, so glad I arrived at commonsense</p>
<p>oh I love Taylor, my heart is lavender panelled.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So I recognized Jess the first time in my laziness</p>
<p>inputting her names, “Logic’s wife”, in indolence</p>
<p>following that, on Spotify for days she repeated</p>
<p>the tracklist was pop for the first time in my ears</p>
<p>her voice conveyed feelings and pain condensed</p>
<p>calling out all that was not; of her love unrequited</p>
<p>she signalled an uncouth Logic in her bereavement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I was never a social media person, not an adept</p>
<p>I’d use only a little Facebook, only until recent</p>
<p>my thoughts about them were of things on edge</p>
<p>it wasn’t until months I caught other news events</p>
<p>they both were divorced, and the rest is in tablet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Back then, I was Logic’s fanboy, the greatest</p>
<p>a member of the RattPack, he was real BFF</p>
<p>his is the first rap album I listened top to end</p>
<p>Young Sinatra: Welcome to Forever realm</p>
<p>The Marshall Mathers LP 2 dismemberment</p>
<p>Kanye West’s Life of Pablo has to be next</p>
<p>and Drake’s More Life asked if I’d start afresh </p>
<p>it struck and reminded me of clear-headedness</p>
<p>it felt great, being a cool kid as consequence</p>
<p>my personality rubbed off on him on enrolment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Logic is married? I can, oh bless!</p>
<p>that was real, and there is evidence</p>
<p>H.I.V was inspired from my attempt</p>
<p>heartbreak in view, the precedence</p>
<p>dedicated to whom is the guiltiest</p>
<p>my debut mixtape, an aid to reflect</p>
<p>it’s my work serving as an epithet</p>
<p>it’s the relapse tune playing plangent.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If Jess was true, then we both dated</p>
<p>for our relationship was resplendent</p>
<p>it’s one I still reel, mewl over and flex</p>
<p>she is still a muse, that cairn mistress</p>
<p>an upgrade for bye to the pinchbeck</p>
<p>I could be a star with this affair bracelet</p>
<p>it was like that the first time we parted</p>
<p>she’d push me, as she would too, direct</p>
<p>put more balls, act older, always protect</p>
<p>it’s love, do not be afraid of being witless</p>
<p>won’t you frown at the covert; the trinket</p>
<p>use X more, if you mean it, say it, express</p>
<p>to avoid her inbox, to own it, to just blend</p>
<p>soon I was out here, beyond the outskirts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And the masturbation? it was grotesque</p>
<p>of seeds a younger Miley Cyrus planted</p>
<p>a fap a day keeps haters round the bend</p>
<p>finally getting watering in its pure essence</p>
<p>she’d me wank off so hard, she was cruel</p>
<p>I once had to jerk off twice to get sated</p>
<p>mind’s lost if you’re wife, is what I texted</p>
<p>domesticated in my bed in piquantnesss.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She had it coming to repulsive hems</p>
<p>the Anon thought of it as immodest</p>
<p>loads of them, videos made with zest</p>
<p>sexy and public taste for preference</p>
<p>and pictures to keep my mind isolated</p>
<p>with details for preferential treatment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I stopped porn and became obsessed</p>
<p>I’d wanted to, but it’d create a wrench</p>
<p>but not with a book’s content digested</p>
<p>a book that was Brian Rose mediated</p>
<p>with that, our relationship was created</p>
<p>and I no longer deplored my existence</p>
<p>with the shock from telepathy spent</p>
<p>she’d my trust and my acquiescence</p>
<p>her friends restored my confidence</p>
<p>Ryan Bailey Potter’s attentiveness </p>
<p>alongside Judy Sollee’s keenness</p>
<p>with Lindsay Kulik’s intuitiveness</p>
<p>my old life seemed to be supplanted</p>
<p>so I told her, as a man willing intends</p>
<p>to be my wife; to hit the nail perfect</p>
<p>with a yes, she thought more befitted</p>
<p>Shayna Terese Taylor’s emergence</p>
<p>and by Shayna’s moral appropriateness</p>
<p>a sorority for my coming inner impairment.</p>

 <p>Jess’s first birthday in the tie, a month ahead</p>
<p>I started a series of writing to her daily poems</p>
<p>through April and May, on X the poetry spread</p>
<p>while not leaving our two birthdays unconnected</p>
<p>three weeks apart, I went on writing too for myself</p>
<p>the poems are a part of my first poetry instalment</p>
<p>as so, initially inspired, but for Taylor Swift edited</p>
<p>it felt good rededicating them, it is the best sequel</p>
<p>congrats to Taylor Swift on being a billionairess.</p>

<p>At Disney, Pooh was our tie’s embodiment</p>
<p>sweet as honey and filled with more fondness</p>
<p>there with her friend, and mum for a year’s peg</p>
<p>beautiful Lindsay Kulik and caring Antoinette.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Her mum’s hard on rebuking the Anon with jest</p>
<p>while seeing the day’s posts, from its amusement</p>
<p>her mum’s funny faces, I goofed being careless</p>
<p>from giggling, my laptop fell down in an accident</p>
<p>I lost my hard disk and the posts I’d downloaded</p>
<p>I had backups of Jess’s content, for its vitalness</p>
<p>straight from trauma memories; cultish sentiment</p>
<p>away from home, I restored it on my replacement</p>
<p>my PC was back only for the cash I accumulated</p>
<p>at home, it would have been a different tangent.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A year ago, I’d recorded her in my diary guileless</p>
<p>not knowing the true value of my own strengths</p>
<p>or fate’s invincible closing in connection thread</p>
<p>she visited 18, and with 17, the day not to forget</p>
<p>in the month of May, just weeks before I fled deft.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In my journal, it’s the day her music got a refresh</p>
<p>by some tracks off her album, asking if she wept</p>
<p>few weeks later, on Instagram, I slid into her DM</p>
<p>hence our anniversary is born of this very figment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And May 18 is of suicide thoughts, and XCX</p>
<p>of her hotline help, from her musical creativeness</p>
<p>but I wasn’t new to her sound nosh nourishment </p>
<p>back from Dubai, I smoked crack after fidgets</p>
<p>twice or thrice, I wandered into the detainment</p>
<p>the hood’s noise gripped and I was so inhibited</p>
<p>I’d no dependence but suffered embattlement</p>
<p>I used hoping it’d release me from entanglement </p>
<p>the day of my last use, in the hyper mindfulness</p>
<p>listening to her song Lucky as if decompressed</p>
<p>she advised me, comforting words that drenched</p>
<p>I didn’t feel loco, but lucky, it was raw intelligence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There is a workshop close so it’s never noiseless</p>
<p>you add that with the Anon, here it’s ever strident</p>
<p>my first morning back in the country, never clankless</p>
<p>XCX sounds protected me from oversensitiveness</p>
<p>in the bathroom I remember feeling it was priceless</p>
<p>Charli XCX the album boomed loud and resorbent.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For her, I found A. G. Cook, the silver element</p>
<p>and if my cooking to gold isn’t in affectedness</p>
<p>maybe he’ll work with me, serve me cold ampere.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>James Rotschild promises I’ll never be penniless</p>
<p>if distinctions are clear in my mind from the onset</p>
<p>nothing beats gold, and silver is the next emollient</p>
<p>so keep your silver close, as abreast as your lapel.</p>

 <p>It’s your dad’s dream she says, Naomi Campbell</p>
<p>my dad loves Mariam Rod in her delectableness</p>
<p>he sees what I see, man’s desire in words, sculpted</p>
<p>her waiting; hanging as the long tresses of Rapunzel</p>
<p>it’s how I daydreamed those early days I depended</p>
<p>thrusting her behind, that reverie was my headrest </p>
<p>I’d just met her, and I couldn’t help it, I was smeared</p>
<p>I wanted us together, to be one in soft coalescence</p>
<p>so when Kris Jenner threw a nudge and instructed</p>
<p>writing her music and poetry excused my coarseness</p>
<p>I hope I’ll get to write for Billie, and also as frequent</p>
<p>and while busy, dad made of us exemplar of rashness</p>
<p>it’s why she’s housewife with a home, but with no pets</p>
<p>earth knows I’ve asked her to be wife times countless </p>
<p>she’s either missing something or I lost an ingredient.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>How you get a girl like that for scoundrels</p>
<p>be the man with a big purse, be the toughest</p>
<p>be dummy to her reasons, as your weakness</p>
<p>and expose her to your under-crest tempest</p>
<p>an early knowledge of how high your eminence</p>
<p>foremost, her emmet, cry out you’re her best.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I really wanted Mariam to save me from the gauntlet</p>
<p>the Anon and the world, hence my mind’s aboiement</p>
<p>Jess wasn’t sure what I meant by damsel in distress</p>
<p>she was sure other ladies awaited my impulsiveness</p>
<p>maybe she did, and it’s possible she wasn’t interested</p>
<p>with desire to have my child, long lessons even in recess</p>
<p>Taylor probably lays dibs on Jess’s opinionatedness</p>
<p>and Kendall wanted my work growing into a big ben</p>
<p>but princess Leonor came in; naturalization granted</p>
<p>oh my baby sways; for all my enemies she’s oppressed.</p>

 <p>I met Teodora Dan in Mariam’s benevolence</p>
<p>in our convos, I was the sheep in awkwardness</p>
<p>sweet Teodora wanted a freestyle that’d whet</p>
<p>it’s my job after all, and it wasn’t all in terseness</p>
<p>in there I bemoaned to her one of my old fears</p>
<p>not meeting up to the bar level that is expected</p>
<p>let’s say fulfilment; afford my kids entitlements</p>
<p>an ex Romanian beauty queen for my stiffness</p>
<p>coming from my roots, I saw life as being lenient.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I met Nika Mariana, and met with peak grimness</p>
<p>it is in a night vision I met with the atrociousness</p>
<p>asleep, my natural parents begin the horridness</p>
<p>spilling kegs of petrol to charge inflammableness</p>
<p>after slashes on my scalp and body restrainment</p>
<p>I begged overpowered in shrivelled tangibleness</p>
<p>and was soon aflame needing an extinguishment</p>
<p>they then walked out of my bedroom remorseless</p>
<p>I woke up, this was the first night in acquaintance</p>
<p>from Teodora’s introduction to the mirthlessness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mariam reminds me of PIMP remix by 50 Cent</p>
<p>Snoop Dogg is in there and his ladies, naked</p>
<p>it was the thrill of the time, a lasting appetence</p>
<p>plainly  the collection’s pirates ‘d stiff sternness</p>
<p>throwing ‘tween a music video of ladies topless</p>
<p>that was my first, I’d never seen boobs braless</p>
<p>and though the adults brought home the object</p>
<p>after my afterschool use I positioned it innocent.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was in PIMP style and from a shooting turret</p>
<p>I told Justin Skye, sex once and I’d be overfed</p>
<p>no other time dear, I did so in Future’s eliteness</p>
<p>I just wanted to know her better, hence I imitated.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In high school I knew Snoop first for his lewdness</p>
<p>his doggy style sex position commanded reverence</p>
<p>and he’d the longest male member of notoriousness</p>
<p>PIMP remix wasn’t porn but close to the deterrence</p>
<p>so uncle snoop was here making sure I’m disobedient</p>
<p>just like my colleagues who’d heard him repeat amen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mac & Devin Go to High School caused my rend</p>
<p>I was in uni when I saw the movie; a permit to be pert</p>
<p>I started using and everything fell apart in sloppiness</p>
<p>I was smoking ghetto weed until I hit the presentiment</p>
<p>I stopped using, and made a clean sweep as I amended</p>
<p>and years later shirked even my fav, Kelsy Karter on X</p>
<p>for at the time her posts portrayed use for obviousness</p>
<p>now I’m convinced she’s an actress, I’ve been recruited.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’d an idea to fill out my ellipsis for a reestablishment</p>
<p>my first poetry collection would get the author’s yep</p>
<p>the first synopsis discussed my use and old nescience</p>
<p>for the second edition, an author’s note was selected</p>
<p>and revering no one more or anyone more prominent</p>
<p>Snoop Dogg was my mark, the one I truly addressed</p>
<p>as then, I remain grateful for this tentative eloquence</p>
<p>all that time unhealthy and abusing was my evasiveness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So I sent 50 Cent’s 2023 BET award to the deluded</p>
<p>it is an image congratulating 50 Cent on victoriousness</p>
<p>it’s the Hustler of The Year, category for compartment</p>
<p>my old business partner had to be aware that I had sided</p>
<p>and I’ve done more with 50 cents than his embellishments</p>
<p>also that the Gary Vaynerchuk I’m taken meme that I sent</p>
<p>I meant it, I wasn’t on my way to him, not with this lucidness</p>
<p>to say I’m a millionaire by that currency we both transacted</p>
<p>it’s dollar for the holla, because my pitch’s been the highest </p>
<p>not too shy admitting I fapped to Nicki Minaj erubescent</p>
<p>it was on Anaconda, and no suicide for me or embitterment</p>
<p>not when you get Michael Rubin’s invites, if only intermittent</p>
<p>and how I hit the age a venture capitalist in style gracefulness</p>
<p>and also a genius, since he ruined my brain, as he’d orchestrated</p>
<p>def not when your putz image to Chiara Ferragni isn’t nesh</p>
<p>I love Italy, no regrets, not by entrancing Madelaine Petsch</p>
<p>she acquainted me, there're less men I’d kiss as I’d signore Fedez</p>

<p>I swear blind, not a handful, if wrong, lose my instrument</p>

<p>a Super Bowl Sunday, on Chiara, my dad commented</p>
<p>he told me Chiara is my doctor, word also on internment</p>
<p>I’m attracted to her, those mother tits, great complement</p>
<p>but it could be her mum, an author with published novels.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I met Alissa that cruel summer; the sweetness</p>
<p>and she was very kind, a true light in darkness</p>
<p>as if we’d both arrived, she was in my defence</p>
<p>she’d post for my mornings and also for sunset </p>
<p>I had met Chantel on X’s who to follow widget</p>
<p>still at my first stop, and it left me flabbergasted</p>
<p>the algorithms ‘d word from one of DJ’s finest</p>
<p>she’d be here for me; the memo, like a theorem</p>

<p>we met before, but I’m not one to be indulgent</p>
<p>well, a stupid white girl trying to pick out a dress</p>
<p>my comments before continuing to surf the web</p>
<p>I was mad at her meme, and language thriftiness</p>
<p>blame Lil Peep’s Cry Alone, saying I was bereft</p>
<p>since I mentioned it, I’m sorry, I feel it’s demented.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Meeting her again, now pals, it was all comminuted</p>
<p>so that girl could be a virgin after a larceny bisect</p>
<p>why impolitely, she barked to go fix my hairlessness</p>
<p>it didn’t matter, it didn’t make her less of a portent</p>
<p>for my thoughts were: this Christian girl is minded.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Jess and I trailed off with the violence</p>
<p>tendencies for emotional eruptiveness</p>
<p>we split and I ended up with the Violet.</p>

 <p>I’d become a famous dork, but also inept</p>
<p>so she fussed a couple times over unrest</p>
<p>talks about our duo and unfair garishness</p>
<p>I’d made a song pissing heads for repress</p>
<p>also Alissa wasn’t sure of my profuseness</p>
<p>she wanted me with others, being different</p>
<p>as being Taylor’s hubby could stir ferment</p>
<p>but husband only in the books I’d collected?</p>
<p>So this held up the first collection’s pre-empt.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That sort of marriage was the strangest</p>
<p>her cyber actions were the close sentinels</p>
<p>those early days, it felt like a confinement</p>
<p>and knowledge share showed a prickliness</p>
<p>with my old uni colleague turning for wicked</p>
<p>she expected that I’d invest in a new mindset</p>
<p>as her suggestions guided me up a high ledge</p>
<p>for jumping hand in hand, together in tandem.</p>

<p>If I ever did that, trust anyone, utterly unchecked </p>
<p>it’d be Lana Del Rey, unravelling this beingness</p>
<p>the early days I’d prepare weed, make it esculent</p>
<p>watch Joseph Prince sermons, have my moments</p>
<p>at times I was off it for days from the soddenness</p>
<p>my life was hers, I held her words and experimented</p>
<p>I was bold by the right things, and privately reckless.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I guess it’s just like Katy Perry and Richie Lionel</p>
<p>I have over two hundred songs, all freestyle gems</p>
<p>it was Katy Perry’s idea, to which Lionel nodded</p>
<p>cos of their charge, I’ve amassed the great harvest</p>
<p>it helped me discover the intimacy in consciousness</p>
<p>a release and grip of thoughts as I spout percepts</p>
<p>there I found Frith’s love for Addison Rae, an err</p>
<p>a wonderful, beautiful err, quenching my phoniness</p>
<p>like Trevor Daniel’s Falling, I felt what I’d never felt</p>
<p>I trust my teachers, whatever the advice, I take care.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So when Camila Mendes appeared</p>
<p>it’s Veronica Lodge, I’m still attracted</p>
<p>I cried having woken up to fresh semen</p>
<p>she is hot, but I perceived it pointless</p>
<p>with no vision of any coitus, I just wept</p>
<p>what ‘d have been a beautiful squelch</p>
<p>was too fast . . . argh! the brain’s science.</p>

<p>I followed Riverdale up until Luke Perry’s death</p>
<p>just right around the period my relapse erupted</p>
<p>early 2019, a newcomer to the series around then</p>
<p>gobbling celebrity gossip, I stumbled on a snippet</p>
<p>an ad on its synopsis about a teacher and student</p>
<p>both in love, just like Taylor Swift and I in breast</p>
<p>well, until Lili showed up, and took over that apex</p>
<p>Taylor was in hiding, sworn to her business signet</p>
<p>she seldom had any public event or announcements</p>
<p>her social accounts were lonely like an ostrich’s nest</p>
<p>but one far above the ground for any bird flightless.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I was making her a music tape for a birthday present</p>
<p>it’s when it happened, the seduction of a temptress</p>
<p>yes, I saw it coming, but couldn’t refuse Lili’s love set</p>
<p>a warm teacher, guiding me to fall in love to represent</p>
<p>maybe Taylor? I mean it’s Hollywood, sworn to infest</p>
<p>just look at Taylor breaking records, she’s a goddess</p>
<p>I’d come around, to learn, grow and foremost to excel</p>
<p>Lili says I’m an actor because of the songs I penned</p>
<p>as if to dissuade our love so celebrated, one so patent.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I wrote a couple songs, and on one I offered a parapet</p>
<p>for me, Hollywood actresses are the tier for my cement</p>
<p>it ends or starts with me sending a prenup for an ascend</p>
<p>as if saying to her, out of everyone, I chose you I meant</p>
<p>for I still ‘d a lot of lovers anyway, but it was wakefulness</p>
<p>Kendall is my girl, Taylor I do, and Lili got the document</p>
<p>and weeks ago for princess Leonor it went into annulment.</p>

<p>I met Carmella Rose in beautiful eros flair</p>
<p>her first photograph locked on swiftness</p>
<p>she posed by a vintage car, Junoesque</p>
<p>a sports car, skirt, and thighs talented</p>
<p>all over her, in love with her abdomen</p>
<p>zippy with my intentions, undiluted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There was a roaming stray cat she petted</p>
<p>I thought it a priggish endeavour as listless</p>
<p>it could have been jealousy for its safety belt</p>
<p>arriving with a male owner leaving me toothless</p>
<p>for I love her as I do the creatures of the planet</p>
<p>the unison of purpose to experience life is sexless.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She got another, hers, he’s a feline to be kept</p>
<p>I love him; as adorable as a fluffy mollusc shell</p>
<p>always underwater in mood, in his own current</p>
<p>with zero worries but Rose’s overindulgence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Done pissing, by Jess, my doubts were as impermanent</p>
<p>Jess brought me in, Kendall mooring me was depascent</p>
<p>but with a lack of resources dashing out disillusionment</p>
<p>several shots in, I longed for my old team’s empowerment</p>
<p>the clarity of the beautiful people loving me in confluence</p>
<p>the job so far ‘d been carried out with maximum stolidness</p>
<p>for two days, my reasons, back at me, they’d been pelleted</p>
<p>and soon I was about to get their new offer, one I’d regret</p>
<p>it’d take the big theft to see what was always here instead.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Kendall Jenner, that supermodel, here daily, uninterrupted</p>
<p>most days it just felt that way, I was on reality supplements</p>
<p>before leaving to eat, I didn’t know that or what was cogent.</p>

 <p>For as schleps do, I too only met</p>
<p>the same loot as slobs expected</p>
<p>as he’d said, I’d throw the towel</p>
<p>he was right and I am impressed</p>
<p>as one who experienced a spell</p>
<p>but I blame it on day two’s event.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The second day of my round-wake bet</p>
<p>I arrived back home to a smothering mess</p>
<p>my phone, three shirts and crude gibbets</p>
<p>seeing the phone brought a relaxing belch</p>
<p>the shirts were door knobs to retirement</p>
<p>the crude execution was a daylight theft</p>
<p>it’s the sole reason on the third day I fled</p>
<p>astir, opposing unrequited sleep’s effect</p>
<p>with the sun still forgotten far to the west</p>
<p>not of being late, but for the plain stealth</p>
<p>for a lightweight in his workaday habiliment</p>
<p>with no extra tog, a new odd, I was bagless</p>
<p>it being the aftermath of abusive torrents</p>
<p>I didn’t own the bag, the eve’s tale’s wedge.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The bag was an item left not stolen or stepped</p>
<p>a lot ‘d been taken with no conscience or chest</p>
<p>chest for I found no heart, at least not whence</p>
<p>so I returned on the third day in greasy garments.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My volition remained from contriteness</p>
<p>the third was my conscience on its tread</p>
<p>as I knew I’d make money, hit it, and net</p>
<p>no longer with the PC in need of repair</p>
<p>the owner ‘d come for it, ringing my bell</p>
<p>but I got my first manuscript submitted</p>
<p>also a twenty-five track tape recorded</p>
<p>also a number of epistles got funnelled</p>
<p>with keyboard glitches the bottleneck.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I felt my phone offered ways to conquest</p>
<p>I’d resume my rampage, continue to attest</p>
<p>show I was not in any way the loafing earth</p>
<p>convince I’m a legit programmer who’d dealt.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is not hard to believe or to digest</p>
<p>I’m not Rothschild or birth in wealth</p>
<p>like the other man, I too need bread</p>
<p>Nicky Hilton sells loafers, is a celeb</p>
<p>seen her chocolate advertisements?</p>
<p>She’s an influencer and also a model</p>
<p>and I’m a known budding young poet</p>
<p>when this book began on my blogette</p>
<p>Demi Lovato showed the best cheer</p>
<p>if good poetry, poet, and proponent</p>
<p>it’s identity spelled in imperviousness </p>
<p>just how a dictionary bars and clears.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My phone put some thoughts to rest</p>
<p>all day, crossing my mind was a guess</p>
<p>I’d continue the drudgery committed</p>
<p>ultimately needing one month to tend</p>
<p>two payslips to leave well resuscitated</p>
<p>the first would be to affording internet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I returned to quitting from mettle dearth</p>
<p>it was partly because of my juvenescence</p>
<p>and partly cos I’d a phone, what I wanted</p>
<p>I could read books with no inconvenience</p>
<p>like the one with Paris Hilton being pert</p>
<p>but I wasn’t going to be using the ATM</p>
<p>this in my mind was certainly the clearest.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I sat next to a truck that afternoon in the hot temp</p>
<p>my mission’s end with a phone but I got no payment</p>
<p>I’d meet the CSO again, he’d acted so unaffected</p>
<p>I knew he heard my mind rants, they weren’t listless</p>
<p>luring me in as he’d isn’t how one should be treated</p>
<p>made to leave without any end to the drought or pep.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Soon he appears, assuming a phone call reflex</p>
<p>ranting on, I threaten to sue the establishment</p>
<p>I’ll have my wife do it, no, definitely a girlfriend</p>
<p>Tessa Brooks will take care of the detriment</p>
<p>she's told me she wants to, spreading as a tent</p>
<p>one I hoped would cover me in some way or term.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I really was waiting to have it turn dark at best</p>
<p>not having the bag, I’d left in my work threads</p>
<p>leaving smothered was a shameful defacement</p>
<p>and there was the certain pain to giving up ted</p>
<p>the sun that high, it’d be tainting uncouthness</p>
<p>looking without at myself, I’d cry that I was led</p>
<p>by some unclean spirit of an unyielding length.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Off the phone call, he asks that I sit elsewhere</p>
<p>right across the factory gate on a tyre erected</p>
<p>a dude was sat there all the while, as I’d waited</p>
<p>walking down I pondered what he’d suggested </p>
<p>as there were no seats, to his also incongruent</p>
<p>I’d be sitting on the floor, the one non-existent</p>
<p>or perch beside the dude on the tyre, adjacent.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Taller, brawny, fitting the job spec</p>
<p>we chat and meddle across subjects </p>
<p>I was careful with each one as an egg</p>
<p>not long into the conversation dearth</p>
<p>a lad, Austin, joined us disconcerted</p>
<p>he needed workers in a partner outlet</p>
<p>declining my interest, for a tribal fence</p>
<p>one of thieves, crooks; of the usual air</p>
<p>I assure him of my past and deference</p>
<p>my surety goodwill and favourable rep.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Browsing his phone, he hands me inlets</p>
<p>one, of a colleague that’d be the closest</p>
<p>he promised me shelter and a salary crest</p>
<p>better than I would have ‘d here or earned. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I left home with several forms to fill in richness</p>
<p>I felt lucky, the day bright and with no threats.</p>`, 

`<p>Frankly, no one has a hue-clue</p>
<p>of the riff-raff what we do</p>
<p>what I do, for him it's stool</p>
<p>maybe I don't — another fool. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fast food, hard drugs, bad shoes</p>
<p>coming off with a shabby tired ooze</p>
<p>a vigour constantly depleted nude</p>
<p>probably drugs . . . why I aptly moo. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>You'll find him labelled an old coot</p>
<p>the verity of his long-standing fondue</p>
<p>not picking or drawing out his fumbles</p>
<p>but his actions hail and whirr the brew. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>He once bragged, hardly mute</p>
<p>about a private school muse. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the winds, but this, he’d choose</p>
<p>over again in the narrative booth</p>
<p>the local regalia of his big pooch</p>
<p>which is tine, for I know only one mooch</p>
<p>grubby, teeth rust colour, make puke. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A pest I avoided in recurring brush ruse</p>
<p>tell him: I'm not home. I'm too much. Boom! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Another day of the dogged chew.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Too seventeen, and this comfy dude</p>
<p>older, probably taming twenty two.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He visited the cybercafé too often in a spool</p>
<p>talked analytics, Google ads in a spook</p>
<p>long calls, walks on hot afternoons</p>
<p>cheques, needing a phone and root</p>
<p>lavish restaurant visits, same rue.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I never ever crewed </p>
<p>not while back at school</p>
<p>the school — a cybercafé open to recruit</p>
<p>one same business tube</p>
<p>not now, or when he took a pew.</p>

<p>I was on courses that I drew</p>
<p>with nothing else working, all heard hoot. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’d run away in a home boot</p>
<p>left for the neighbouring offshoots</p>
<p>countries carrying a renegade's fume</p>
<p>three nations’ cloud serving in the flee flue. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The university had left me bruised</p>
<p>and I was through, with nothing to brood</p>
<p>I enrolled sixteen, left when shooed</p>
<p>with grades lower than any new dew</p>
<p>for it was an unaccredited course; my truth</p>
<p>on campus unaccredited meant nothing to prove.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Not much is with sixteen in bloom</p>
<p>you eat a lot, I did, TV a lot, I did and read on to-do</p>
<p>only if you’re rich, with other lingos like a rowdydow troop</p>
<p>it’s still English for me, no good for a date with Taylor, it droops.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Time heavy in the cafétéria on food</p>
<p>the TV's home, resuscitating fortitude.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When I read it was usually quantum poop </p>
<p>I loved physics, so it wasn’t a bad quaint flu.</p>

<p>You subscribe to gossip on the menu</p>
<p>whose chic, sexy, goes to the moon?</p>
<p>I rode with the alphas, I was a brute</p>
<p>hostel-bound; transmuted hound rude</p>
<p>and I’d the goods needed out there, I knew </p>
<p>for I sold mobile phones, and gadgets room to room</p>
<p>it’s anything for a fix, to get me back in — with the spoon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>No, not by lecture hours, there wasn't ever a queue</p>
<p>I ate too much, not me for the rush compute. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The kitchen's special . . . that's the pursue</p>
<p>noodles, chips, what sticks, cashew.</p>

<p>I’d wrangling puppy love, same faces roost</p>
<p>year mates always in the top ten countdown soup</p>
<p>oh, it is why her ass is liquid in an assumed bag costume. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I was cool though, a Versace statue</p>
<p>I’d a linen sportswear that read the croon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some dude my height was a pacing glue</p>
<p>nothing in common but matching altitudes</p>
<p>he'd come to my room by night in a drool</p>
<p>with a smell that now would be a loud toot.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He acquainted me with a girl who flew</p>
<p>she'd talk all night saying nothing new</p>
<p>I slept to her words, cover up crude</p>
<p>in the morning, sad she blew</p>
<p>with the stars like every cartoon. </p>

    <p>With a family comes a perspicuous calm</p>

    <p>a rending aureole, pulverising gentle arm</p>

    <p>it’s that one that lets you in the safe pad</p>

    <p>alongside, breathing in the knoll radiance</p>

    <p>ever assuring of the day to come; its spat</p>

    <p>no less, of being better, rising past its nap</p>

    <p>Some several couple of millennia</p>

    <p>my ancestors woke up to loud chants</p>

    <p>midnight, just after their herbs; sleep sodas</p>

    <p>to the knowledge of the newly divined shaman</p>

    <p>a female rapper, and her name was Dlamini Amala</p>

    <p>she told them stories of a coming super-duper computer</p>

    <p>no one knew what that was, so she said it’d help the farmers</p>

    <p>she died twenty-six, and was buried by a cacao tree by her desire</p>

    <p>where today is a twenty-six storey building in Dugbe, a commercial area</p>

    <p>writing, the building is called Cocoa House, <em>it’s the Cocoa Doom</em>, as I entered</p>

    <p>my natural dad introduced to me, he drank alcohol per usual all eve as we relaxed</p>

    <p>the building <em>Ile Awon Agbe</em> was commissioned in 1965, built from revenue agricultural</p>

    <p>the house holds the Odua Museum and Hall of Fame commissioned by Prof. Wole Soyinka.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>Isn’t all that pattern kind of cute Doja Cat?</p>

    <p><em>Amala</em> is the favourite meal among the Yorubas</p>

    <p>from Ibadan city to where I reside currently, Sango-ota</p>

    <p>you were birth after your poor momma ‘d a rind steeple of yam</p>

    <p>I’m saying my desire for you is poetic as I’ve done in the short shamata</p>

    <p>for our little baby <em>Amala</em> now that I’ve got my steeple of good American dollars</p>

    <p>I even involved a Literature Nobel laureate in there if she’s into peace work and all that</p>

    <p>and to think that this book’s title was first inspired by The Los Angeles County Museum of Art?</p>

    <p>well, I love you Amala, I’ve some <em>Dlamini</em> Facebook friends, they are from South Africa and Swaziland.</p>

    <p> <em>Jinx</em> who often is here, the rapper </p>

    <p> and then <em>Bode</em> the man after <em>Fela</em>. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> The afternoon is bustling, cool, cheer, rad</p>

    <p> and I, under the weather by the social graph.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> I was moving for the better bag</p>

    <p>with idleness and a heartbreak past</p>

    <p> remaining sober had been a drag</p>

    <p> my apartment stunk in otiose tacks.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> Long phone calls, clients, crunching numbers</p>

    <p> gig offers lined up, my attendance in panache</p>

    <p> it had to be simple, I couldn't afford dysphoria</p>

    <p> as quitting my job came with reasons; same tract. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> Weed in the tray to remain awake, not enough ash</p>

    <p> feeble, falling asleep, dreading the circadian slam</p>

    <p> past figures littering my after-hours office survival. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> A slim offering presented in good tact</p>

    <p> the right earnings for the circumstance</p>

    <p>what never quite found me in the brash.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> The fumes from the chartered starting cab</p>

    <p> like the festering items on old receipts pats. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> Those of whiskey drunk with no chaser</p>

    <p> reminding me of my generator's palaver.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> I had just sold off my bed, for crap</p>

    <p> the luxury thing put me in a class. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> For a month or so, I slept on the floor tired</p>

    <p> no reasons, I can't get to it with my keypad.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> On a bottle for days, I had expectorant</p>

    <p> to knock me out as I finish with dinner.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> I got a house, but no bed for every relevance</p>

    <p> my first home, today I move out a studio flat.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> I didn't have everything, I’d the dream ramp</p>

    <p> the early days, a fresh graduate bootstrapped. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> After my graduation, I got a good job, no ads</p>

    <p>my publishing platform under their umbrella </p>

    <p> employed to work with my dibs, no contracts</p>

    <p>promised a life with security, I even got a car</p>

    <p> it was my first job before this one I now back.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> I continued for months as my salary got larger</p>

    <p> I was over a hundred percent from the dash</p>

    <p> when a colleague came to me with the draft. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> Our first meet was on a Skype video chat</p>

    <p> with the colleague who came up on brand</p>

    <p> by my advice of a social engineering tab</p>

    <p> same course as I in uni, cursed to philander. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> I got the gig, someone knew; there was a rat</p>

    <p>so I was being monitored for the slightest lax.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> Six times my salary, I'd hit on a formula</p>

    <p> it felt like a windfall; an available capital</p>

    <p> but a colleague cadged I invested grand</p>

    <p> I paid for the fake crypto and lost a stash.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> The Christmas holidays came in a taper</p>

    <p> prototyping, with an IOS app to deliver</p>

    <p> not resuming; thoughts of a day later</p>

    <p> my actions left me with only two paths</p>

    <p> sell off the platform, still I get the sack. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> My wait by the carrel amidst noisy clacks</p>

    <p> the brand rat with offerings, I remember.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> It was a shock, the sudden jolt waker</p>

    <p> playing in there was heavenly ballad</p>

    <p> with audio and visual studio grants</p>

    <p> everything in there — a dream painter.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> I left not selling, pondering the beater. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> Than I thought, the mole was closer</p>

    <p> a developer in a goss so unequivocal</p>

    <p> allays to me in dismissing shorthand.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> It took me a very long walk to ponder</p>

    <p>the rat had introduced us, it was smart</p>

    <p>and I brought him in too, good nuisance.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> Calling for maintenance: the gig employer</p>

    <p> I inform him of the retaining withdrawal. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> <em>I am interested in a company, a starter </em></p>

    <p> I'd be going in as a partner; a survivor</p>

    <p>or I’d been setup, it’d been orchestral?</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> The text read: <em>we have work to do.</em> Knack!</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> It was for over a year and five months lap</p>

    <p> with three apartments and couple sandals. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> It was different there, maybe the manager </p>

    <p> I had one for a while before her sabbatical </p>

    <p> she sure needed more care from her doula</p>

    <p>when she left I realised I’d been my whetter.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> My music really did go up the standard</p>

    <p>after XXXtentacion’s moonlight’s bam</p>

    <p> I made a cover and got a lot of playbacks</p>

    <p>my first exposure, so I left my old habitat.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> Since my move for the bag, the bigger</p>

    <p> so much has changed, now I spot abs</p>

    <p>everyone does next to Kendall Jenner</p>

    <p> I haven't mentioned my CPRM colossal</p>

    <p>music postings to X like the corp’s staff</p>

    <p> and I've got a DJ wife, Chantel is my scarf.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> <em>While you work, play music for a bolster</em></p>

    <p> his advice like every din, only to distract. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> He thought himself the ideal I sought; a baba</p>

    <p> <em>People like you never make it, they finish last</em></p>

    <p>for a share on his FB of my book, the first part</p>

    <p>I made clear I’m a billionaire, so he’ll scamper</p>

    <p>he didn’t share the second, good for a smack</p>

    <p>ended his facade, he isn’t a reader or listener</p>

    <p>always by the Anon’s vice, my case’s ringleader</p>

    <p>so he’s managed to be their satisfying accuser.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> <em>Lie for sex and you lose yourself in the strand</em></p>

    <p>with his hands on the wheel of his motorcar</p>

    <p> he and the rat had the penchant, so l yarned. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> They both drop their bottles and I get a flash</p>

    <p> of an old attendant and her suggestive rants</p>

    <p>talks about spending the night and good jazz</p>

    <p> having a good singing voice and other banter</p>

    <p>Zayn Malik’s Pillow talk, I asked her for a cover</p>

    <p>word is she left with a tranche, hit the tarmac</p>

    <p> her boss says: <em>she's got child, can you call her?</em></p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p>Part one and part two’s titles to closing chapters</p>

    <p>the names of the companies I was employed at.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> We get in the car and not long I'm in trance</p>

    <p>I was here, only for forethought, and muster.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> I went in April for the job, active maintenance</p>

    <p> he’d tons of ideas, so I came up with schemas </p>

    <p> the live product needed considerable revamp</p>

    <p> following his lead, we arrive at a joint appraisal. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> Months later, too few hands, we went modular</p>

    <p> each service ripped and offered as an individual</p>

    <p>for hands, just me; I was convinced it was initial</p>

    <p> but a year later, with few remote regular testers</p>

    <p> fanciful ambitious plans, it all now was fanatical</p>

    <p> and also too impossible, without another expert.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> If there is congruency, no need for a snap</p>

    <p> things dragged for a while, felt scattered </p>

    <p> with still a lot to do, finished jobs stagnant</p>

    <p> it felt futile and I sensed a total disregard.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> He hadn't been about his job, and I was on my guard</p>

    <p> the product ready, personal priorities became my act</p>

    <p> without bouts of being sober, it'd remained a mirage</p>

    <p>the now completed tasks with the dream in preserve.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> Three months I went in, the sobering lad</p>

    <p> relapse, then another short clean prance. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> Continuing was unreasonable without one in the glass</p>

    <p> a fledged service in his hands, the hands of a vandal</p>

    <p> weighing from our commitments, I was drawn aback</p>

    <p> working under sore conditions, harsh wilts, and warps</p>

    <p> my health deteriorated from stress, my mind suffered. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> Here is a countdown to my leaving, I loved my lab</p>

    <p> in there, a lot went down, productive a constant. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> The music platform ready, I register as a musician</p>

    <p> I was playing multiple roles in the Venn diagram. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> I was making my mixtape all about the grad</p>

    <p> I was talking about it, I’d achieved a nirvana</p>

    <p>H.I.V, <em>heart break in view</em>, my own first platter.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> And then it happened, some technical crags</p>

    <p> and the realization, I knew no professionals.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p>Ever in the office, too busy, crown champ</p>

    <p> I was home 'cause they needed to relax</p>

    <p> unwind, the office sure wasn’t the camp.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> <em>Jinx</em> wasn't around, he’s a different batch </p>

    <p> but group recordings ‘d begun in catch</p>

    <p> I was doing everything to keep the match.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> The electricity generator had gone blat</p>

    <p> I had it fixed only to get way up its amp.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> Always, if home — in the reoccurring stab.</p>

    <p> I switched parts like I didn't the same lunar. </p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>The day session ended with me being a retard</p>

    <p>with two laptop chargers bunt and a girl’s bra.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p><em>Let's fuck 'fore your mind blanches.</em></p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> She was calling reserved, she had a grab</p>

    <p> a twirling dolour, if a true objective remark.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> It didn't make much sense but a fart</p>

    <p> we met on a dating app via Instagram.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> it’s the last time we spoke, she sure is stellar. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> Jinx drinks a lot of alcohol, he has a feel brag</p>

    <p> smiles a lot and thinks of himself a load bearer</p>

    <p> coming around with bags, and likes it with sharks. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> Dropping in, I tell him I quit, and also got a garland.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> He only ever left to, or claimed to launder</p>

    <p> the line or whirr, can't tell what the matter. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> <em>Study literary terms for that special clad</em></p>

    <p><em> </em>he seemed bogus, fine by only entendre.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>Unexcited, repudiating totally, not a fan</p>

    <p> he ask why I've got that music on bang</p>

    <p>Tekashi69, aggressive was my trademark</p>

    <p>the message totally read: <em>oh I’ve no paper</em></p>

    <p> and for anyone, it was purely coincidental</p>

    <p>it was weeks ago before my move’s grasp.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> Restlessness, and bemooded a total gaffer</p>

    <p> he soon leaves, so I beckon to, and he sits. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> Alcoholism in his absence needed I ask</p>

    <p> <em>what is wrong with the up programme?</em></p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> I was veering off the impromptu wham</p>

    <p> I was smoking and drinking, living a scam</p>

    <p> with days sousing my volition in sot tatters.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p><em>Kiss and Make Up </em>was the song important</p>

    <p>it repeated in my ears as I tried to retract</p>

    <p>their voices were my only harrying charge</p>

    <p>I was new to BLACKPINK, but not Dua Lipa</p>

    <p>without my headphones, life was cruel cack.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> Still, I never went for a big bottle, the lethal</p>

    <p> a small whisky bottle on the kitchen counter</p>

    <p> bleeding to love unrequited, as it turned scar</p>

    <p> whiffs of smoke and steady with the stopper. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> On a quiet, still afternoon, I scribbled on an unrolled rizla</p>

    <p> words to encourage, then flushed the weed in a dance</p>

    <p> it was a workday, by the compound's ambience as usual.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> Remaining there, nothing would change, nada</p>

    <p> with extra corned beef, no alcohol in my cart</p>

    <p> I seize the bull wearing the fine fur of the tiger. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> I boldly said no to money for months in a dagger</p>

    <p> and today I was following through with the march</p>

    <p>so better, I pick up my phone, calling home in a dial.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> <em>Feelings of a tense claustrophobic ashram</em></p>

    <p><em> it’s unhinged, it's the weed, in here it's crammed</em></p>

    <p><em> I shouldn't have smoked weed</em>, in shy stutter</p>

    <p> <em>I'll be going clean, not much luck in my trials.</em> </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> My girlfriend and her sis in the compart</p>

    <p>seeing YouTube videos, Nicki Minaj’s</p>

    <p> the evening started late to his contact</p>

    <p> so I invited her, she was with her little sister. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> On our first date we had fruit salad</p>

    <p> the day was for our goodbyes, official.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> I'd remain in town, not run home. Be a man!</p>

    <p> <em>the end of my tech dream</em>, he silently crabbed. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> The job offered financial stability; the finger</p>

    <p> funded my musical whims, very significant </p>

    <p> but hours to pay day, another salary in hand</p>

    <p> my break, a resignation, a sleight of hand plan</p>

    <p> he didn't expect that, not my I quit cataract. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> The timer was shrilling, I was switching vats</p>

    <p> homecoming; three years chasing thunder. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> In the moving shuttle, I thought of the I quit strap</p>

    <p> also my hold on will and the twinkling guise star</p>

    <p> what it'd take to alight at my planned benchmark. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> My rent was ending soon, I'd be a sort of tenant</p>

    <p> all over again at home, and it’s how I'll be starred. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> A good son back home, frugal, not prodigal</p>

    <p> thirty percent of stake in his name, the cards</p>

    <p> <em>cards everybody</em>, intervention sole, and heart.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>A minute slack and you're hassled but a prat</p>

    <p> and so you pray it’s only counting for a palm</p>

    <p>they see this time, a miracle to their handicap</p>

    <p> as you're welcomed home to a meddling alas. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> It takes some, and clonk of gusto to rid the sham. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> For going clean isn't just a track</p>

    <p> the gangway leading to the path</p>

    <p> getting off and joining the band. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> The sphere is safe, the light is the lamp.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p>Well in after my arrival, several months thereafter</p>

    <p> in a fight, I boast of my health and got the shatter</p>
<p><br/></p>
    <p>I got a face slap, like every natural mum won't be happier</p>

    <p> I have found my hope now, but not here, it's in America. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> I arrive and it's a sudden grim air of spar</p>

    <p> the air noisily in, a gusty rush so verbal. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> The win to coming back here isn't stark</p>

    <p> subtle: a controlled environment; plaid</p>

    <p>that was before the Anon’s style starch</p>

    <p> electricity too, I used to wish for a feather. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> No warnings, I get a call from the caretaker </p>

    <p> my apartment got a pound note, no stickers</p>

    <p> I'll need to show up, for my good, to depart. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> I'd been home only a day, I went under. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> I got the apartment in a move-out crack</p>

    <p> my partner had it arranged for its vent shaft</p>

    <p> I moved a floor to tiny cockroaches in alter. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p>Life in my natural parent’s home is pretty matt</p>

    <p> there was school, no TV, two arches, five verandas. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> Five children, one step, one interred</p>

    <p> and now I suspect an insanity plaque</p>

    <p> talks of my late sister not with the sand</p>

    <p> the repeated gambit isn't anywhere a farce.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> It's heart exhuming, a spooky expanse</p>

    <p> I saw her in my dream, it was so Stygian.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> The animated dead with creepy things all over</p>

    <p> her face, out her nose, with my belt: <em>let me help ya</em></p>

    <p> if those things moved, I'd never trust my oblongata</p>

    <p>and last time asleep, she asked for keys, I left in a rash.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> Not much memory; heckling pedestrians</p>

    <p>losers by the fence with opinions as rivals</p>

    <p> guess this made me tougher, never blank.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> While everyone operates generators, nah!</p>

    <p> enjoyed electricity once, a new transformer</p>

    <p> I had just started using; weed, maybe a fad</p>

    <p> electricity to help me grow dumb, dumber? </p>

    <p> four years I used, everyday, on a lucid <em>I can</em></p>

    <p>I spent the time experiencing life in the alps.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> After graduation I felt cord stuck in a tank</p>

    <p> stuck home with a habit I had to feed sap</p>

    <p> I picked up smoking last year uni in a hatch</p>

    <p> all joy a sis’s friend introduced me to the land.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> I had the nefarious desire, she knew the clan</p>

    <p> before him, she'd help buy it, bear the skank. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> Clean lunged, those guys crawled in pangs</p>

    <p> campus was different, the town: really bad.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> Juju charms and teeming with Draculas</p>

    <p> growing up; common knowledge gram.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> <i>Don't go around there, too many altars</i></p>

    <p> <i>there you'll find the demon worshippers.</i></p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> Past childhood, it persisted, and it rang</p>

    <p> rang, and rang, never without a twang. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> Alone with a pen, I doodled the rant</p>

    <p> same word, lost in my head, I sank</p>

    <p> in the word, <em>BODE</em>, <em>BODE</em>, to adapt</p>

    <p> page filled, with a mindless to infer. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> The nascent of the odd, its start. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> Jinx's pal: <em>Bode</em> lives in a palace.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> <em>Fela had ladies from my dad.</em></p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> <em>My dad owns these nudity mags.</em></p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> Remembering the day his dad passed</p>

    <p> I had on a shirt of blue and camouflage</p>

    <p> it had on its pectoral, a disturbing facade</p>

    <p> reading <s>MONEY FINE</s>, crossed, to wither.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>He called out the design; our chat snatch.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>I was in a ghetto, respect for the human</p>

    <p>but carats would have impressed as a stag</p>

    <p> a good evening, not a bad try of the litotical.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> Now sober, the thought train is still as banal</p>

    <p> if I killed him, like an accidental gun discharge</p>

    <p>I later heard him rebuking, I was in the backyard</p>

    <p> he complained, upset his youngest son is a brat</p>

    <p>how fine was I really or not? It was his rejoinder</p>

    <p>the brat took him, humour me, he's the winner.</p>

    <p>I got word the next day, and also of his burial</p>

    <p>I shunned the invitation, the rites were Islam.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> When I met Bode, it was a weed blast</p>

    <p> it wasn't synchronicity playing in a harp. </p>

    <p> I don't go around in willy remembrance</p>

    <p> watching for my mind's teenage prank. </p>

    <p> his own daughter, too many girlfriends, too sexual</p>

    <p> I had not until recent, my edible clamber</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> <em>Mosquito</em> they called him, he had the arms</p>

    <p> we took photos, his pipe shone in the dark</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> After graduation, I kind of got into janitorial </p>

    <p> I saw more pipes and bongs than any hypeman</p>

    <p> maybe I just dreamed of them as I programmed. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> Cleaning my pipe one morning by the tap</p>

    <p> it fell like a joke, and came next, the pack. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> I got the pipe from some partners</p>

    <p> who wanted an online product stand</p>

    <p> it was an e-commerce store offer. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> I had designed it more times growing dismal</p>

    <p> every night or try in a different remote folder</p>

    <p> it wasn't at all difficult, I just had brain cramps.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> It was a bad habit, not showing off my tan</p>

    <p> from all that flame, a dissuading <em>now I shall</em>. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> Fresh out of uni, with my job's sac</p>

    <p> I just needed this for the ruin river</p>

    <p>more money with a lone stoner</p>

    <p>he crossed and was gone forever.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> A legal cannabis device store yard</p>

    <p> too sad I was busy smoking grass</p>

    <p>I could have been some Wiz Khalifa.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> </p>

    <p> </p>

    <p> </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> I came home with the forms, a break in of petard</p>

    <p> Austin needed them signed, and filled sharp</p>

    <p> my wait was over, I was now moving away, far!</p>

    <p> not so far, but now than ever before, further</p>

    <p>of the Anon, I pondered what I would uncover</p>

    <p>it lasted only a few days, it was an Anon desert</p>

    <p>Red, Taylor’s version was new, it was my shelter</p>

    <p>and I only messaged Kendall, it was just natural</p>

    <p>I even sent her videos, only if it ‘d lasted longer.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>My natural dad signed and provided his data</p>

    <p> while not releasing any ID card to be exact</p>

    <p> I had his shirts, I now was ready than ever</p>

    <p> I needed the ID proof, but he couldn't bother</p>

    <p> If I got some fare, I could fine, go and starve</p>

    <p>he told me to borrow, the amount in a sucker</p>

    <p> I was going to work anyway, get some fodder</p>

    <p> it was evening, his usual meet time, no angers.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> I left a day later with nothing but thrash</p>

    <p>all that I owned, I was leaving with my bank</p>

    <p>I did with every thread and shoe that I had</p>

    <p> waving to every care in a farewell disarm</p>

    <p> big bag on my head wishing of the bantam. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> I got few rolls of milk, tea, detergent, and sugar</p>

    <p> also a new cup, old bowl and a basin of cassava. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> A day before leaving, hungry I opened the container </p>

    <p> but was welcomed by literal thrash, and old wrappers. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> My natural mum's plan was for an unrecyclable slap</p>

    <p> too bad I was too hungry for her plotted away spank.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> Food has always been a problem, a true fact</p>

    <p>the Ibadan people were very good hunters</p>

    <p>and Amala isn’t the sole aim of any gatherer</p>

    <p>oh my Leonor, she is the Princess of Asturias.</p>

<p>SHAME TO FAME.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The words on his cap's face</p>
<p>from a post on his Facebook page</p>

    <p>Leaving for Dubai was uneventful and drab</p>

    <p> unlike the days leading to of attempted swab</p>

    <p>as with this book, if reading, of strident perusal</p>

    <p>chapters two, four, six, ten, a pipe to transform her</p>

    <p>skip the eighth, let’s see if I don’t shit myself on arrival.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> Long pompous evenings, floating in chaffs</p>

    <p> glib ridicule closing in good night staggers</p>

    <p> like a mentor, he'd knock, back, sitting errant</p>

    <p>the same days Grant Cardone’s voice whispered.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> He’d wait by the <em>new house</em>, next the outside tap</p>

    <p> with a mountain of tasks, traipsing in no regard</p>

    <p> I’d lock on my fallibility, whetting; I was no charm. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> The late conversations clagged in artful meanders</p>

    <p> the new house, so called has no lock, an easy barge</p>

    <p> there is a duster to muff, as the wind sings every bang </p>

    <p> the house isn't my table but it's been a good coaster</p>

    <p> I live in the next building, in there it's quite a big haggard</p>

    <p> the parlour, dining room, and the kitchen, hasn’t any spag</p>

    <p> even when it is dark outside, in the parlour it is ever darker </p>

    <p> without curtains, the moonlight crowds in a bright cancer.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> But now he speaks of an hotelier</p>

    <p> he says he owns nothing, utter</p>

    <p> I'll be leaving for a masters.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> Not saying who is saint but who drapes better</p>

    <p>only he cared for my graduation’s appearance.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> I sure was going on a far errand</p>

    <p> not a son, an investment he sang</p>

    <p> in his usual stranger danger chant. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> <em>You only need a flight and visa</em></p>

    <p><em> and cert attestation stamps</em>.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> For this we went to the capital</p>

    <p> a day's ride, west to central</p>

    <p>Carly Rae Jepsen’s <em>EMOTION</em> sat.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> We checked in on arrival in Abuja</p>

    <p> his friend, picked us up at the park</p>

    <p> and the next day to the offices, federal. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> I took a passport that morning I still have</p>

    <p> nothing about the photograph is pleasant</p>

    <p> threatened, scared with a clean shave visage. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <img alt="Passport" class="img-fluid lazy" src="../../images/loading.gif"  data-src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DbRDYZmMRu/fhw-two/refs/heads/main/books/1965/passport.jpg"/>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> <em>The network is down</em>, everyone around muttered</p>

    <p> for a server needing scaling, we offered our prayers. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> I switched vendors on long walks with other critters</p>

    <p> and all the time I feigned my own disbelief of the matter. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> I had with me a frottage seeking fellow pedestrian</p>

    <p> to his delight, he whined about everything national</p>

    <p> speaking in his tribal tongue at me, his fit was urban</p>

    <p> and in time he asked of where I was from in a bark</p>

    <p>today, I’d say Spain, let me be, America, whatever.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> Back at the first vendor, where reception stands</p>

    <p> she claimed it always did, <em>just pray, do your part.</em> </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> I did as I rebuked everyone who had a valid pass</p>

    <p> the server was slothfully delivering servlet apps</p>

    <p> and in time I got mine processed, as she cashed. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p>The final office stop was some floors high, several</p>

    <p> I met girls headed for other nations, one, Russia</p>

    <p> a man, older men, no aged woman in that foya</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> She came from the elevator, rotund with the ass</p>

    <p> fine one that one, but I didn't look twice in dismissal</p>

    <p>I only used the stairs, my shyness had birthed a litter</p>

    <p> maybe if alone, if no one had heard all of his hollers</p>

    <p> parent to ruin my life, fritzed propellers, that helicopter.</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> Back at the hotel, with his first son's mum, a squawker</p>

    <p> on about me being a street boy, we left two days after</p>

    <p>well I didn’t buy the earmuffs, a celeb gets less attacks.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <p>It hit weird, came out wrong, for a customs officer</p>

    <p> whose daily, enjoyed alcohol with motorcycle riders</p>

    <p> for sane, not innocent me, what else? Contraband?</p>

    <p><br/></p>

    <p> The call was unapologetic, and now I had a boulder</p>

    <p> I always did, but now I could boldly call it my father. </p>

    <p><br/></p>

  <p class="text-center mt-1" >the night wasn't at all different from the one I got the first notification on YouTube, from Jess' channel, but this was on the home feed when I loaded the app. I wasn't big on alcohol, so prior, I'd never heard the word <i>bourbon</i>, preposterous right? But there is more.<br/> I was suffering. Music heals the spirit, but at times, a friendly voice, a sentimental atmosphere is the salve for a heartache. I'd bruised my self-esteem again from using months past; arriving from Dubai. I felt I deserved the Anon's noise, the hardship previously orchestrated for me, me in place as an axle. <br/> Just because of the series of videos, maybe it's why when I met Jess, I could write her. <br/>
<i>Introducing Wild Turkey Longbranch</i>. It was the breeze of confidence, a content so foreign and outside from what I'd expect.<br/> Friendship had found me at home, <i>family</i>, and it was a bourbon, by Master Distiller Jimmy and Eddie Russell, made in their fine DNA with Matthew McConaughey as creative director. <br/> Now I'm counting down to Bourbon, head to Madrid for education. <br/> I wonder if Princess Leonor knew about it, don't forget she's got super computers. <br/>The kindest words I'd heard in a while, by far months, as Matthew McConaughey described what Longbranch was in its simplest form:<br/> <i>the extension of a hand, an invitation, a welcome, when friends can become family.</i><br/> <i>Mesquite!
